The flames of the campaign to implement the Party's ideas and defend its policies have unfolded a proud reality of our indigenous plane flying in the sky and our indigenous subway train running under the ground, and rich fish and fruit harvests were gathered, their socialist flavour bringing pleasure to the people. Our sportspeople including the trustworthy women's soccer players exalted the honour of their motherland and further encouraged the militant spirit of our service personnel and people by winning gold medals in international competitions.\nThrough the large-scale events held to celebrate the Party's 70th anniversary drawing the attention of the world, we demonstrated far and wide the might of the single-hearted unity of all the service personnel and people around the Party and the bright future of Juche Korea.\nThe moving scenes unfolded on the October celebration square shook the world with power greater than that of explosion of an atomic bomb or that of the launching of an earth satellite, and clearly showed that nothing can check the dynamic advance of our Party, service personnel and people that are fighting with the single-hearted unity and arms as their ever-victorious weapons.\nLast year our service personnel and people warded off the danger of war facing their country and nation and safeguarded the dignity of the Republic and world peace with honour.\nThat we neutralized the hair-trigger situation teetering on the brink of armed conflict owing to the grave political and military provocations by the hostile forces and defended the dignity and security of our motherland from possible calamities is a brilliant victory born of the Herculean might of the great army-people unity and of the powerful Paektusan revolutionary army.\nWhat makes us look back upon last year with greater delight is that our young vanguard who are reliably carrying forward the lineage of the Juche revolution and faith demonstrated the might of the youth power without parallel in the world by means of their loyalty to the Party and heroic struggle.\nEducated and trained in the embrace of the great leaders and the Party, our young people rushed ahead along the course of the Korean revolution set by the Party, creating the charging spirit and culture of young people of the Songun era and performing laudable deeds that touched people's heartstrings. The millions of young people, fully equipped with the revolutionary ideology of the great leaders and firmly rallied behind the Party, have grown strong in ideas and faith, to become successors to the cause of the Juche revolution. This is the greatest dignity, pride and success for us.\nAll the victories and successes achieved last year are a fruition born of the heroic struggle of our people, who turned out in the general offensive for their country's prosperity with the spirit and mettle of Paektu, and a crystallization of the invaluable blood and sweat the service personnel and people dedicated to the country and the revolution.\nSpending last year seething with creation and filled with miraculous achievements together with the service personnel and people, who were burning their hearts with patriotism and loyalty, our Party witnessed with a warm feeling their beautiful spiritual world and strenuous struggle and gained greater strength and courage from their trust-filled look and sincere opinions.\nAs there are the Party's sagacious leadership, the invincible army and the great people that absolutely support the Party and defend it unto death, we have no difficulties to be afraid of and can accomplish any great cause without fail-this is the proud conclusion of last year's struggle.\nI extend warm thanks to all the members of the Workers' Party of Korea, service personnel and people who glorified last year with heroic struggle and feats in devoted support of the cause of the Party cherishing ardent loyalty to it and faith in sure victory.\nComrades,\nThis year is a significant year when the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea is to be held.\nThe congress will proudly review the successes our Party has achieved in the revolution and construction under the wise guidance of the great leaders, and unfold an ambitious blueprint for hastening final victory for our revolution.\nWe should celebrate the Seventh Party Congress as a glorious meeting of victors as it will constitute a historic landmark in carrying out the cause of the Juche revolution.\n\"Let us usher in a golden age in building a thriving nation in this year when the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea is to be held!\"-this is the militant slogan our Party and people should uphold as they advance.\nAll Party members, service personnel and other people should turn out as one with ardent loyalty to the Party and extraordinary patriotic zeal, and demonstrate the spirit and mettle of Korea that is rushing forward towards final victory racing against time.\nWe should concentrate all our efforts on building an economic giant to bring about a fresh turn in developing the country's economy and improving the people's standard of living.\nIn order to achieve breakthroughs for a turning point in building an economic giant the electric-power, coal-mining and metallurgical industries and the rail transport sector should advance dynamically in the vanguard of the general offensive.\nThe problem of electricity should be resolved as an undertaking involving the whole Party and the whole state. The existing power stations should be kept in a good state of maintenance, bolstered up and run at full capacity to ensure maximum output of electric power. The construction of the Tanchon Power Station and other projects for boosting the country's power-generating capacity should be promoted along with the efforts to ease the strain on electricity supply by making proactive use of natural energy. All sectors and all units should wage a vigorous campaign to economize on electricity and make effective use of it. The sector of coal-mining industry should raise the fierce flames of an upsurge in production to ensure enough supply of coal for the thermal power stations and several sectors of the national economy.\nThe state should take thoroughgoing measures to make certain that the sector of metallurgical industry receives adequate material supplies and the metallurgical factories, such as the Kim Chaek and Hwanghae iron and steel complexes, expand the successes achieved in making their production Juche-based and modern. By doing so it can increase the output of iron and steel. The rail transport sector should establish rigid discipline and increase effectiveness in organizing and controlling transport services to ensure regular operation of trains, and step up the modernization of railways.\nOur Party maintains the improvement of the people's living conditions as the most important of the numerous state affairs.\nThe crop farming, animal husbandry and fishing sectors should make innovations to effect a radical change in improving the people's standard of living. The agricultural sector should actively adopt superior strains and scientific farming methods, speed up the comprehensive mechanization of the rural economy and take strict measures for each farming process, so as to carry out the cereals production plan without fail. The animal husbandry and fishing sectors, which are waging an all-out struggle in response to the Party's call, should ramp up production as soon as possible and see to it that the fish farms, vegetable greenhouses and mushroom production bases built across the country pay off. Thus they can contribute to enriching the people's diet.\nThe light industry sector should put its factories and enterprises on a highly modern footing, provide them with plenty of raw and other materials to keep their production going full steam and increase the number of world-famous products and commodities with a competitive edge.\nConstruction is a yardstick and visual evidence for the strength of a country and the quality of its civilization; it constitutes a worthwhile, important undertaking for embodying our Party's people-oriented policies. The construction sector should launch a general offensive to implement the Party's construction policy and grand plan. By doing so, it should build important production facilities, educational and cultural institutions and dwelling houses on the highest possible level and at the fastest possible speed, so that they serve as standards and models of the times. In this way it can make sure that the great heyday of construction continues without letup.\nAll the sectors of the national economy should set ambitious goals and maintain regular production by tapping every possible internal reserve and potentiality. They should also take it as an important policy-oriented requirement to improve product quality, ensure domestic production of equipment and rely on locally available raw and other materials, and make strenuous efforts to this end.\nThe whole Party, the entire army and all the people should buckle down to the campaign to restore the forests of the country.\nThe urban and rural areas, workplaces and villages should be kept spick and span, and positive measures should be taken to conserve the resources of the country and prevent air, river and sea pollution.\nOur Party is steadfast in its determination and will to solidify the foundations of a thriving country by dint of science and technology and, with them as the engine, achieve national prosperity. The scientific research sector should give priority to resolving the scientific and technological problems that arise in consolidating the might of the Juche-based industry, the socialist independent economy, and improving the people's standard of living, and strive to push back the frontiers of science and technology. Factories, enterprises and cooperative farms should build science and technology diffusion rooms in a splendid fashion and put their operation on a regular basis, so as to ensure that all the working people learn modern science and technology. It is also necessary to establish a social climate of resolving the problems arising in reality on the strength of science and technology.\nThe Cabinet and other state and economic organs should decisively improve their economic planning and guidance. Leading economic officials should fully equip themselves with Party policy, work out plans of the economic work in an innovative way and give a strong push to it on the principle of developing all the sectors at an exponential speed by relying on the inexhaustible creative strength of the working people and by dint of modern science and technology. They should accurately identify the main link in the whole chain of economic development and concentrate efforts on it while revitalizing the overall economy, especially when the conditions are not favourable and many difficulties arise. They should be proactive in organizing and launching the work of establishing on a full scale our style of economic management method which embodies the Juche idea, thus giving full play to its advantages and vitality.\nThe political and military might of our Republic should be strengthened in every way.\nIt is necessary to cement the politico-ideological position of socialism rock-solid.\nWe should regard ideology as the driving force of the revolution and focus on the five-point education so as to train all the service personnel and people to be strong in ideas, to etch in their hearts the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu, and encourage them to give free rein to their indomitable mental strength in the struggle to carry out the instructions of the great leaders and safeguard the Party's policies. Political work and frontline-style information and motivational work should be vigorously conducted to ensure that the whole country seethes with an atmosphere of heightened political enthusiasm in the lead-up to the Seventh Party Congress.\nSingle-hearted unity is the great foundation and ever-victorious weapon for the Juche revolution. All the officials, Party members and other working people should connect their burning hearts with the garden of the offices of the Party Central Committee and share the Party's ideas, breathe the same breath as it and keep pace with it in order to travel one road forever following the Party. Party organizations and state organs should give absolute priority to the demands and interests of the people by thoroughly applying the politics of prioritizing, respecting and loving them, and take responsible care of their political integrity and material and cultural life to the end. Party organizations should take hold of public sentiments, rally the broad sections of the masses closely around the Party, and launch an intensive struggle among officials against all practices of abuse of power, bureaucratism and corruption that gnaw at and undermine our single-hearted unity.\nThe country's defence capability should be built up.\nIn this year, which marks the 20th anniversary of the movement of winning the title of O Jung Hup-led 7th Regiment initiated by General Kim Jong Il, the People's Army should further develop itself into a revolutionary army of the Party in which the Party's unified command system is thoroughly established, into a steadfast army of the Party that keeps the revolutionary faith to the death, and effect a turnaround in implementing the Party's four-point line of building up the army to be formidable. By keeping it as the seed to conduct training in a real-war atmosphere and put it on a scientific and modern footing, the army should raise the fierce flames of training so that all the service personnel are prepared to be elite soldiers of modern warfare and stout fighters who are equipped with the military strategies and tactics of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the heroic fighting spirit and flawless abilities to fight an actual war. It should become a standard-bearer and shock force of the times to make breakthroughs as intended by the Party on the major fronts where a thriving country is being built, and look for more tasks that are for the good of the people.\nOfficers and men of the Korean People's Internal Security Forces should smash in embryo the manoeuvrings of the class enemy and hostile elements to harm the leadership of the revolution, our socialist system and our people's lives and property, and members of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and the Young Red Guards should intensify combat and political training and fully prepare themselves to defend their villages.\nThe munitions industry sector should develop defence science and technology, put the defence industry on a highly Juche-oriented, modern and scientific footing, and give full play to the revolutionary spirit of Kunja-ri, so as to develop and produce a greater number of various means of military strike of our own style that are capable of overwhelming the enemy.\nWe should ensure that our people enjoy the highest quality of civilization on the highest level.\nBy raising the flames of radical improvement in education in the new century, we should renovate the conditions and environment for education and improve its quality decisively, thereby bringing up talented personnel who are knowledgeable, morally sound and physically strong. We should improve medical treatment and preventive work as required by the socialist public health system in order to protect the people's life and promote their health.\nWe should make sports mass-based and part of daily concern to ensure that the whole country is astir with enthusiasm for sports, and radically develop the specialized sporting techniques to create new miracles of heroic Korea in international games. The sector of art and literature should brace itself to produce a larger number of contemporary masterpieces which make all the service personnel and people burn their hearts with enthusiasm for the revolution and for struggle.\nWe should launch a strong drive to establish discipline with regard to moral ethics so as to ensure that a sound and civilized way of life prevails throughout the country.\nAll the officials and working people should turn out as one in the struggle to usher in a golden age in building a thriving nation in this year when the Seventh Party Congress is to be held.\nIt is the tradition of struggle and temperament of our people to turn out with a single mind and will and continuously work miracles like moving mountains and filling up seas if it is the Party's call.\nThe heroic working class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, as befits the core unit of the Juche revolution and the eldest son of the country, should support the Party's ideas and cause in the vanguard and advance holding up the torch of a new great revolutionary upsurge in building an economic giant. Agricultural workers, with the sense of responsibility that they are in the trench on the first line of the forward echelon of the campaign to defend socialism, should strive to bring about a turn in agricultural production. Intellectuals should promote the building of a thriving country by means of brilliant scientific and technological successes as required by the era of the knowledge-based economy, and become pacesetters and standard-bearers in opening the efflorescence of civilization of the age of the Workers' Party.\nOur Party pins a great hope on the role of young people in today's general advance. Young people, cherishing the trust of the Party that has given prominence to them as masters of the youth power, should train themselves further to be dependable pillars of the country and become artists of miracles and heroes on all the sites where a thriving nation is being built.\nOfficials should immerse themselves in the reality to inspire the masses and conduct every undertaking in a revolutionary and scientific way. They should also become true servants of the people and competent leading personnel of the revolution who make selfless, devoted efforts for the good of the people with the ennobling view of life that they have nothing more to wish for even though their bodies may be scattered like the grains of sand on the road for the good of the people.\nIn all fields of social life we should sustain the original features and great appearances of our society which is advancing on the strength of helping and leading one another forward and through a concerted effort. Our target is a Juche-oriented socialist power, and the might of socialism is none other than the might of collectivism. All sectors and all units should attach primary importance to the interests of the state, the Party and the revolution, introduce the successes and experiences gained by the leading units and make leaps and bounds in the flames of collectivist competition.\nThe principle of giving priority to self-development should be maintained in building a thriving socialist country. Worship of big countries and dependence on foreign forces is the road to national ruin; self-development alone is the road to sustaining the dignity of our country and our nation and to paving a broad avenue for the revolution and construction. With affection, trust, dignity and pride in everything of our own, we should achieve the great cause of building a thriving nation and realize the people's beautiful dreams and ideals without fail by our own efforts, technology and resources.\nNational reunification is the most pressing and vital task facing the nation.\nLast year, greeting the 70th anniversary of national liberation, we appealed to all the compatriots to pool their efforts to open up a broad avenue to independent reunification, and strived for its realization. However, the anti-reunification forces that are not desirous of national reunification and improved inter-Korean relations ran amuck to realize their schemes for a war and even created a touch-and-go situation short of crossfire, causing grave apprehension at home and abroad. The south Korean authorities publicly sought to realize their goal of \"regime change\" in our country and unilateral \"unification of systems\" against the trend of inter-Korean dialogue and detente, and fanned distrust and confrontation between the north and the south.\nThis year we should hold up the slogan \"Let us frustrate the challenges by the anti-reunification forces within and without and usher in a new era of independent reunification!\" and press on with the national reunification movement more vigorously.\nWe should reject foreign intervention and resolve the issues of inter-Korean relations and national reunification independently in keeping with the aspirations and demands of the nation.\nIt is none other than the outside forces that divided our nation, and it is also none other than the United States and its followers that obstruct the reunification of our country. Notwithstanding this, the south Korean authorities are clinging to a smear campaign against the fellow countrymen in collusion with the outside forces while touring foreign countries to ask for the solution of the internal issue of our nation, the issue of its reunification. This is a betrayal of the country and nation that leaves the destiny of the nation at the mercy of the outside forces and sells out its interests.\nThe issues of inter-Korean relations and national reunification should, to all intents and purposes, be resolved by the efforts of our nation in conformity with its independent will and demands, true to the principle of By Our Nation Itself. No one will or can bring our nation reunification.\nThe whole nation should struggle resolutely against the sycophantic and treacherous manoeuvres of the anti-reunification forces to cooperate with the outside forces. The south Korean authorities should discontinue such a humiliating act as going on a tour of foreign countries touting for cooperation in resolving the internal issues of the nation.\nIt is fundamental to realizing the country's reunification to prevent the danger of war and safeguard peace and security in the Korean peninsula.\nToday the peninsula has become the hottest spot in the world and a hotbed of nuclear war owing to the U.S. aggressive strategy for the domination of Asia and its reckless moves for a war against the DPRK. The U.S. and south Korean war maniacs are conducting large-scale military exercises aimed at a nuclear war against the DPRK one after another every year; this is precipitating a critical situation in the Korean peninsula and throwing serious obstacles in the way of improving inter-Korean relations. Last year's August emergency showed that even a trifling, incidental conflict between the north and the south may spark a war and escalate into an all-out war.\nThe U.S. and south Korean authorities must discontinue their extremely dangerous aggressive war exercises and suspend acts of military provocation that aggravates tension in the Korean peninsula.\nIt is our consistent stand to strive with patience for peace in the peninsula and security in the region. However, if aggressors dare to provoke us, though to a slight degree, we will never tolerate it but respond resolutely with a merciless sacred war of justice, a great war for national reunification.\nWe should value such agreements common to the nation as the three principles for national reunification and declarations between the north and the south, and in conformity with them, open up an avenue to improved bilateral relations.\nThese principles and declarations constitute the great reunification programme common to the nation, and all fellow countrymen wish that they are implemented as soon as possible and a radical phase opened up in reunifying the country.\nIf they are sincere about improving inter-Korean relations and reunifying the country peacefully, the south Korean authorities must not seek pointless confrontation of systems, but make it clear that they intend to respect and implement with sincerity the three principles for national reunification, June 15 Joint Declaration and October 4 Declaration, which crystallize the general will of the nation and whose validity has been proved in practice. They should cherish the spirit of the agreement signed last year at the inter-Korean high-level emergency contact, and desist from any act that will lead to a breach of the agreement and mar the atmosphere of dialogue. In the future, too, we will make strenuous efforts to develop inter-Korean talks and improve bilateral relations. We will also have an open-minded discussion on the reunification issue, one of the national issues, with anyone who is truly desirous of national reconciliation and unity, peace and reunification.\nAll the Korean people in the north, in the south and abroad will smash all challenges and obstructive moves by the anti-reunification forces in and out of the country and build a dignified and prosperous reunified Korea on this land without fail under the banner of By Our Nation Itself.\nThe United States has persisted in ignoring our just demand for replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace pact to remove the danger of war, ease tension and create a peaceful environment in the Korean peninsula. Instead, it has clung to its anachronistic policy hostile towards the DPRK, escalating the tension and egging its vassal forces on to stage a \"human rights\" racket against the country. However, no plots and schemes of the enemy could break the indomitable will of our service personnel and people to firmly defend and add brilliance to our style of people-centred socialism, the base of their happy life.\nThe challenges by the hostile forces remain uninterrupted and the situation is as tense as ever, but we will invariably advance along the road of independence, Songun and socialism under the unfurled red flag of the revolution, and make all responsible efforts to safeguard peace and security in the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world.\nOur Party and the government of our Republic will further strengthen solidarity with the peoples of the world who are opposed to aggression and war, domination and subordination, and develop relations of friendship and cooperation with all the countries that respect our national sovereignty and are friendly to us.\nThe cause of Juche-oriented socialism is ever-victorious, and only victory and glory is in store for us who are advancing under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea.\nLet us all strive for the final victory of the revolution full of confidence in victory and optimism.\nGreeting the hope-filled New Year, I wish the people across the country good health and happiness.\n"},{"title":"Inaugural Ceremony of Sci-Tech Complex Held in Presence of Kim Jong Un","body":"Inaugural Ceremony of Sci-Tech Complex Held in Presence of Kim Jong Un\n \nThere took place an inaugural ceremony of the Sci-Tech Complex with splendor in the presence of supreme\nleader Kim Jong Un on Friday, New Year's Day.\nPak Pong Ju, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and premier of the Cabinet, made an address.\nHe said the complex is the center for disseminating latest science and technology provided by the Workers' Party of Korea in the 21st century, the age of knowledge-based economy.\nThe complex is a magnificent edifice for all the people's study meeting diverse purposes to be proud of in the world and an icon of the Juche-oriented architectural art in the great era of Kim Jong Un, he stressed.\nOur people came to have another seat of learning meeting the requirements of a highly civilized socialist nation as the world's best center for disseminating science and technology has been built not only for scientists and technicians but also for other people.\nAmid the playing of the welcome music Kim Jong Un cut the inaugural tape.\nAt the end of the ceremony he went round the complex together with senior officials of the party, state and army.\nGoing round the interior of the complex, he said this is a great center for all-people study and one for disseminating latest science and technology in which the party's plan has been materialized. He said meaningful words that the first gate to the New Year to greet the 7th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea has been opened with science.\nHe called for operating well the complex, the precious wealth of the country, and greatly contributing to making all the people well versed in science and technology, turning the DPRK into a power of science and technology and developing it into a talented nation.\nHe underscored the need for the scientific field to firmly build up forces for developing science and technology, boost creative cooperation among scientists and researchers and widely generalize the successes and experience gained and thus steadily develop the nation's science and technology.\nHe stressed the need for the agricultural sector to make a dynamic technological revolution, apply scientific farming methods, increase the proportion of mechanization in farm work and, at the same time, launch a high-pitched drive for putting farming and stock-breeding on a scientific basis.\nHe underlined the need for the field of education to steadily push forward the work for improving conditions and environment for education in the age of knowledge-based economy and thus train huge ranks of talents who will play important roles in bringing earlier the building of a socialist economic power.\nPresent at the ceremony were Hwang Pyong So, Pak Pong Ju, Kim Ki Nam, Choe Thae Bok, O Su Yong, Ro Tu Chol, officials of the army and society, service personnel, builders and helpers who took part in the construction of the complex, officials and employees of the complex, officials of ministries, national institutions, those of institutions and enterprises, and scientists, educators, youth and students and other working people in Pyongyang.\nPolitical News Team\n"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Watches Firing Contest of KPA Artillery Units","body":"Kim Jong Un Watches Firing Contest of KPA Artillery Units\n \nKim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, watched a firing contest of KPA artillery units.\nTaking part in the contest were artillery sub-units under KPA Large Combined Units 966, 313, 567, 526, 233, 549, 324, 593 and 287.\nAfter hearing a report on the procedure and way of a single-gun firing contest, the Supreme Commander watched the contest at an observation post.\nAll the contestants hit every target with the perfect marksmanship they acquired in routine drills and thus displayed the will of the powerful revolutionary Paektusan army to mercilessly wipe out any provokers against the DPRK, a socialist country.\nWith a broad smile on his face, Kim Jong Un said that the dependable KPA artillerymen are very good at firing and they seem to be well-trained snipers.\nNoting that the single-gun firing method, applied at the contest, is a very good training method for single-shot hit without trial firing, he underlined the need to positively study new ways, contents and methods of training, as required by modern warfare, and thus improve the effectiveness of drills so as to make a fresh progress in staging drills.\nAt the contest the first place was taken by KPA Large Combined Unit 966, the second by Unit 549 and the third by Unit 593.

Jong Un Visits Ministry of People's Armed Forces\n \nKim Jong Un, supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, paid a congratulatory visit to the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces on the occasion of the New Year Juche 105 (2016) that saw the successful first H-bomb test of Juche Korea.\nHe had a significant photo session with commanding officers of the KPA General Political Bureau, the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces and the KPA General Staff in front of the statues of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il at the ministry.\nAt the ministry's conference room he met with commanding officers of the KPA and congratulated them on the New Year.\nThen he informed them of the complicated situation which the Korean revolution is now facing.\nThe DPRK's H-bomb test, conducted at the outset of the year when the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) is to be held, is a self-defensive step for reliably defending the peace on the Korean Peninsula and the regional security from the danger of nuclear war caused by the U.S.-led imperialists, he said, adding it is the legitimate right of a sovereign state and a just action that allows no one to slander.\nHe made an important speech on the main task to be carried out by the KPA this year.\nIt is a general goal of our Party and people for this year to glorify the 7th Congress of the WPK, which will be a historic turning point in accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche, as a glorious meeting of victors and the Party Central Committee pins greatest hope on the People's Army in carrying out this heavy and responsible task, he said, and went on: \"Let us defend the 7th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea by strengthening the political and military might of the People's Army in every way!\"--this is the militant slogan the People's Army should uphold this year.\nHe stressed that it is the feature and peculiarity of the WPK's mode of leadership to strengthen in every way the driving force of the revolution with the People's Army as a core, cultivate our state's self-development capability with the People's Army as a model and achieve the greater victories in reliance on the army and, thanks to this constant principle, the distinguished leadership mode, the WPK will always emerge victorious.\nA shortcut to successfully carrying out the militant tasks facing the People's Army is to deeply study and grasp the behests of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and implement them to the letter unconditionally without an inch of deflection, he said, urging the whole army to put it up as an important slogan to establish the revolutionary habit of study this year.\nSaying that a strict military discipline should be established within the KPA and it should take on a fully standardized appearance, he underlined the need for it to fully apply the anti-Japanese-guerilla-style method of commanding and managing units so that all the work and life of its service personnel

Workers wrote on the petitions for joining or rejoining the army about their determination to settle accounts at the cost of their blood with the enemy who are bringing the cloud of war in their foolish dream of achieving \"system destruction\" in our Republic. Their burning hearts clearly showed how pure and warm the love of our people, including young people, for the Party and the country is, and how fiercely their hatred against the enemy, who are attempting to deprive them of their living base, soars.\nWhile receiving reports on the explosive enthusiasm for enlisting in the army manifested among young people, working people and officials across the country and their determination to take revenge on the enemy, I felt great pride in having such excellent young people and revolutionary comrades, who burn their hearts with the revolutionary spirit and patriotism and never pardon injustice in the slightest, and once again gained infinite strength and courage.\nThat all the service personnel and people live with their lots cast in with the Party Central Committee is the genuine feature of Korea that cannot be found in any other country and in any other era, and it is the physiology of our society which the enemy can never understand. The steel-strong, revolutionary unity of the Party, the army and the people is our greatest strength incomparable to the might of scores, nay, hundreds of A-bombs or H-bombs.\nThere is no people in the world other than ours who, cherishing a thoroughgoing anti-imperialist revolutionary spirit, have achieved one brilliant victory after another in the anti-U.S. showdown that has continued from generation to generation and from one century into the next. As long as it has such a great and heroic people, Songun Korea will always emerge victorious.\nNow the imperialist enemy are making a last-ditch effort to check our onward advance by all means.\nBut they are too ignorant of our people.\nOur heroic people, whom the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il trained throughout their lives, know full well what their motherland means, what a genuine life of a human being is and how they should defend the supreme dignity of the revolution and bring their happiness into reality, and are filled with a firm determination to support the leadership of the Party and the leader with their burning hearts and through an indomitable struggle.\nBy leading all the service personnel and people including young people who are unfailingly faithful to its cause, our Party will completely frustrate all manner of provocative moves by the hostile forces and surely bring the final victory of the Juche revolution.\nWith the same spirit and mettle as they displayed in turning out as one and volunteering for the sacred struggle for defending the country and the revolution, all the service personnel and people including young people should make redoubled efforts in the general offensive to celebrate the Seventh Party Congress as a glorious meeting of victors as it will constitute a historic landmark in carrying out the revolutionary cause of the Workers' Party of Korea.\nIf the U.S. aggressors, the sworn enemy of the Korean people, and their south Korean puppets, a despicable group of traitors to the nation, eventually ignite a war, all the officers and men of the heroic Korean People's Army, our Party's revolutionary armed forces, will give vent to the indignation of the revolutionary army by firing salvoes to reduce the enemy's strongholds to rubble, and win victory in the war to make jubilant cheers for the prospering reunified Korea reverberate far and wide.\nAll the people including our heroic working class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and a steel-strong legion of young people with a rifle in one hand and a hammer, a sickle or a writing brush in the other should thoroughly arm themselves with our Party's revolutionary view on war, intensify their anti-U.S., anti-puppet clique class consciousness and turn their soaring indignation into most strenuous efforts.\nThe working youth and students should achieve greatest successes conducive to building a prospering country by waging an unprecedented labour struggle and intensive studying at their workplaces and schools with the feeling that they are in the same trench as the service personnel.\nAll the fronts and posts should raise the fierce flames of the general offensive to death-defyingly implement the militant tasks presented in the letter of the Party Central Committee to all its members and the joint slogans of the Central Committee and Central Military Commission of the Party, and thus greet the victorious May in a dignified way carrying the records of the 70-day campaign of loyalty inscribed with heroic devotion and shining miracles as well as proud labour results dedicated to the Seventh Party Congress.\nParty and working people's organizations should conduct offensive-style political and ideological work in a concentrated way and rouse the entire Party and all society to display mass heroism as never before. By doing so, in the 70-day campaign that is proceeding forcefully day and night they can create a new spirit representative of the Mallima era of Juche Korea and a new heroic fighting mettle.\nI firmly believe that all the service personnel and people including young people, who always cherish a feeling of attachment to the garden of the offices of the Party Central Committee, will give free rein to the indomitable mental strength and the spirit of self-development they have cultivated under our Party's concern, and brave grave challenges of history so as to achieve the victory of the cause of Juche-oriented socialism and communism without fail and demonstrate the dignity and might of Kim Il Sung's nation and Kim Jong Il's Korea to the whole world.\nPolitical News Team\n"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Visits Thaesong Machine Factory","body":"Kim Jong Un Visits Thaesong Machine Factory\n \nKim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, inspected the Thaesong Machine Factory and set forth the tasks for its modernization.\nNoting that the officials and workers of the factory have carried through its production assignments for the past decades, thus working proud feats for the development of the nation's machine-building industry, he gave thanks in the name of the Workers' Party of Korea to them.\nHe toured a room for education in the revolutionary history at the factory.\nCarefully seeing the historic mementoes on display, he said that every part of the factory has sacred traces of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il.\nThe room has been built very well, he said, adding: Primary efforts should be directed to the education in the great leaders' exploits so that the workers of the factory can glorify the undying feats with big achievements in production, well aware of how important their factory is.\nHe went round combined processing workshop, assembling workshop and other parts of the factory to learn in detail about its production and performance and quality of finished products.\nSaying that the Thaesong Machine Factory, the eldest, pioneer and core factory in the machine-building industry of the country, has a very important role to play in building a thriving nation, he stressed the need to modernize it as required by the age of knowledge-based economy.\nThe factory's production and technology management process should be turned into one of development and creative style, not sample-imitation style, he said, adding his visit is aimed to lay a new springboard for the development of the country's machine-building industry through modernization of the factory.\nIt is the intention of the Party Central Committee to turn the Thaesong Machine Factory into a world-level ultra-modern machine producer, he said, and went on: The work for modernizing the factory should be viewed and undertaken as an important and strategic affair related to the future of the development of the country's machine-building industry.\nHe gave precious instructions for modernization of the factory and took necessary measures.\nNoting he felt the very high degree of revolutionary zeal and spirit of the workers at the factory struggling with their firm resolution to proudly attend the Seventh Congress of the WPK with a record-book on campaign of loyalty, he said: There will be no fortress unconquerable for us when we go with those workers.\nHe expressed expectation and belief that the officials and workers of the factory would completely renew the factory to meet the demand of the age of knowledge-based economy and the needs of a highly civilized socialist nation and bring about a great upsurge in the production of modern machines urgently needed for various economic fields and thus creditably play the role of vanguard and shock brigade in the struggle for development of the country's economy.\nHe was accompanied by Jo Yong Won and Kim Jong Sik, vice department directors of the WPK Central Committee.\nPolitical News Team\n"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Guides Test-fire of New Multiple Launch Rocket System","body":"Kim Jong Un Guides Test-fire of New Multiple Launch Rocket System\n \nThe U.S. imperialists and their followers' flagrant moves for political and economic pressure and military aggression on the DPRK have gone to a grave phase that can no longer be overlooked.

of Korea University\n \nSupreme leader Kim Jong Un Sunday sent a message of congratulations to the teaching staff and students of Korea University on its diamond jubilee.\nThe full text of the message of congratulations reads as follows:\nI, in the name of the people in the homeland, extend warm congratulations and compatriotic greetings, along with the hearts of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, to all the teaching staff, students and graduates of Korea University who are celebrating their university's 60th founding anniversary at a meaningful time when the dignity and national strength of our Democratic People's Republic of Korea are being demonstrated on the highest level and a new era of prosperity is dawning in the country.\nThe 60-year history of Korea University is a history of the deep, warm and ennobling affection for the compatriots and the nation cherished by the peerlessly great men of Mt Paektu, who made every possible effort for the education of the younger generations of Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan), and a history of patriotic devotion with which the officials of Chongryon and other compatriots resident in Japan worked to safeguard their democratic national rights and promote national education.\nUntil the last period of his life since he had Korea University built in the heart of Japan as the supreme temple of democratic national education during the difficult period of postwar rehabilitation, President Kim Il Sung showed unstinting affection and benevolence for the development of Chongryon and Korea University.\nIt was under his warm care that, even when the country was facing economic difficulties, a large amount of educational aid funds and stipends were sent to the students of Korea University on a yearly basis; such a legendary tale of great love is unprecedented in the history of overseas compatriots' movement.\nGeneral Kim Jong Il made painstaking efforts to build up Korea University, which was developed under the President's close concern, into the base for training Chongryon officials where the ideological and leadership system of Juche has been thoroughly established, and into the \"pedigree farm\" for training native talents.\nDespite his tight schedule for the Songun-based revolutionary leadership, the General met the teaching staff and students of Korea University, according them the greatest honour, and showed particular care and benevolence for the bright future of the university.\nThe paternal love he showed to train the children of Chongryon-affiliated compatriots into dependable successors to the patriotic cause permeates the whole of Korea University–faculties, educational system, curriculum, modern educational equipment, specimens of animals and plants, and campus.\nIndeed, the President and the General were the founder and builder of our Korea University, benevolent fathers and mentors of its teaching staff and students, and Korea University is, both in name and in reality, the university of the President and the General, the DPRK's dignified, Juche-oriented university for overseas compatriots, which was founded and built up under the great leaders' benevolent care.\nOver the past 60 years since its establishment Korea University, as the supreme temple of national education, centre of scientific research and bulwark for the preservation of the national identity, has rendered a great service to building up the organizations of Chongryon and developing the movement of Koreans in Japan under the wise guidance and warm care of the great leaders.\nIn the past the teaching staff of the university have devoted their all to the national education of Chongryon without pursuit of any personal fame or reward, and its graduates have performed with credit the core role in developing the movement of Koreans in Japan by taking over the baton of love for their homeland and nation.\nRecorded in the chapters of the proud history traversed by the university are the ardent patriotic loyalty and devoted efforts of the university graduates and their parents and other compatriots from all walks of life in Japan who have worked with devotion for the development of Chongryon and the future of the movement of Koreans in Japan.\nBecause we have such dependable patriots who strive not for their own wealth and prosperity but solely for the development of national education and Chongryon, invariably following the road of patriotism on which nobody can easily embark in an alien land where money talks, the dignity of our country is further exalted and the baton of the patriotic cause of Chongryon is being carried forward reliably.\nKorea University, the one and only university in the world for a country's overseas compatriots, is indeed a source of great pride and honour for our country and nation and a precious asset for Chongryon and Korean compatriots in Japan.\nI extend warm thanks to all the teaching staff of the university, officials of Chongryon and other Korean compatriots in Japan who, as gardeners and foundation for cultivating the flower garden of national education of Chongryon, have rendered a positive contribution to founding and developing Korea University, upholding the great leaders' Juche-oriented idea of national education and leadership.\nToday, when the movement of Koreans in Japan has entered a historic stage of ushering in its new heyday holding the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in high esteem in the vanguard of the Juche-oriented overseas compatriots' movement, Korea University shoulders a very heavy responsibility.\nIn accordance with the historic mission and basic duty it has assumed before the times and the country the university should train all its students to be the backbone of the movement of Koreans in Japan and reliable successors to the patriotic cause, who are possessed with an ennobling spirit and profound knowledge, so as to continuously demonstrate its prestige and fame as the university of the overseas citizens of the dignified DPRK.\nThe tradition of loyalty and love for the country and nation is the original feature and lifeblood of Korea University.\nKorea University should champion and add eternal brilliance to the great leaders' immortal leadership exploits associated with it and establish in it the ideological and leadership system of Juche in a more thoroughgoing way, so as to train all its students to be the youth core who are fully equipped with the Juche-oriented outlook on the world and are ready to share life and death with their socialist homeland whatever the situation.\nIt should produce a larger number of competent experts ideologically steadfast and well-versed in science and technology as demanded by the organizations of Chongryon and the community of Koreans in Japan, by establishing the Juche orientation in national education and putting the contents and methods of education on a patriotic, scientific and IT footing in line with the requirements of the movement of Koreans in Japan and the new century.\nIn order to train students to be reliable youth core and patriotic talents who can shoulder the future of the movement of Koreans in Japan, teachers, who are in direct charge of education and edification, should become genuine revolutionaries and educationists.\nTeachers of Korea University, by steadily improving their political and ideological, scientific and technological qualifications, should ensure political and ideological character, scientific accuracy and applicability of the contents of education, and conduct all forms of education, including lessons and seminars, in conformity with the levels of the students and their ages and psychological features.\nCherishing a high aim and beautiful dreams and ideals to shoulder the future of Chongryon and the movement of Koreans in Japan, all the students of Korea University should learn and learn zealously, keep up-to-date with the reality of their prospering socialist homeland and breathe the same air as it all the time.\nThe committee of the Korean Youth League in Japan at Korea University should prepare all the students as pillars of the patriotic cause, who are steadfast in their faith and ready to devote their all to their organization and collective, by establishing a revolutionary habit of studying and effectively conducting five-point education among students.\nNational education is the lifeline and great foundation of the movement of Koreans in Japan which has a bearing on the destiny of Chongryon and determines the success or failure of its patriotic cause.\nOrganizations, affiliates and other organs of Chongryon at all levels including its Central Standing Committee should bear deep in mind that the lifeline of the movement of Koreans in Japan is guaranteed by Korea University, the supreme temple of national education, take warm care of its students as their own flesh and blood, and vigorously advance the educational work of the university as an undertaking involving the whole community of Koreans in Japan.\nBright and promising is the future of Korea University shining together with the august names of the peerlessly great men of Mt Paektu, and definite is final victory for Chongryon and the movement of Koreans in Japan as there is a large contingent of reliable successors who are studying at this university, the \"pedigree farm\" for training the core of Chongryon.\nI firmly believe that Korea University will fully guarantee the long-term development of the Juche-oriented movement of Koreans in Japan by training reliable successors to the patriotic cause of Chongryon as intended and desired by the great leaders.\n"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Visits Kumsusan Palace of Sun","body":"Kim Jong Un Visits Kumsusan Palace of Sun\n \nKim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of

the brilliant victory of our revolution and the present glory of the socialist country are attributable to their priceless blood and self-sacrifice.\nTo the memory of the anti-Japanese revolutionary war veterans, patriotic martyrs, unforgettable revolutionary comrades-in-arms of our Party and pro-reunification, patriotic figures who laid down their precious lives in the struggle for socialist construction, national reunification and the cause of global independence, I propose to observe a minute's silence.\nComrades,\nThe Seventh Congress of the WPK has been convened at a historic time when the phase of leap forward in implementing the cause of the Juche revolution is being opened up.\nThe last decades since the Sixth Congress of the WPK were characterized by grim struggle and glorious victory on the part of our Party and people.\nDuring the period under review the situation of our revolution was very grave and complex.\nIn the unprecedentedly hard times when the world socialist system collapsed and the allied imperialist forces concentrated their anti-socialist offensive on our Republic, our Party and people were compelled to fight against them single-handed.\nThe imperialists strained the situation constantly for decades to keep our people from living at peace even for a moment and blocked all the pathways to economic development and existence through all manner of blockade, pressure and sanctions.\nIn the face of harsh and manifold difficulties and ordeals and the hardships and sufferings worse than those during a war, our Party and people were united more firmly around the Central Committee of the WPK, holding the President and the General in high esteem as the centre of unity and leadership, and made strenuous efforts to defend and advance the socialist cause, following only the revolutionary line of Juche put forward by the great leaders as they braved the storm of history without the slightest hesitation or vacillation.\nAs there were the wise leadership of the President and the General and the might of single-hearted unity of the WPK, the army and the people around the leader, we were able to etch proud victories in history, smashing the schemes of the allied imperialist forces to stifle the Republic at every step and safeguarding the red flag of socialism and the gains of the revolution to the last.\nDuring the period under review, the WPK embodied the Juche-oriented line of party building of General Kim Jong Il to become a powerful body, ideologically pure and organizationally integrated, in which oneness has been achieved in ideology and leadership and to develop into a motherly party assuming the responsibility for the destiny of the masses of the people, an ever-victorious party with seasoned and sophisticated art of leadership and a steel-strong and promising revolutionary party.\nThis year when the Seventh Congress of the WPK is held, our service personnel and people achieved great successes in the first hydrogen bomb test and the launch of earth observation satellite Kwangmyongsong 4 which served as landmarks in the nation's history spanning 5 000 years, thus raising the dignity and might of Juche Korea to the highest level possible; in high spirits, they conducted a dynamic 70-day campaign of loyalty to perform great feats and make unprecedented labour successes in all fields of socialist construction.\nAll the service personnel and people throughout the country displayed the spirit of carrying out the policies of the WPK to the death in response to its militant call for launching the 70-day campaign, thereby making the greatest successes and leap forward in all sectors of the national economy and achieving the brilliant result of exceeding the targets of the campaign set by the WPK.\nDuring the campaign, the electric-power, coal-mining and metallurgical industries and rail transport sector strove hard for increased output and transport to bring about a surge in production, and many units in different sectors of the national economy including the machine-building, chemical, building-materials and light industries and agriculture raised a strong wind to ensure modernization and domestic production of our style and bring about an upswing in production, thus making the distinguished achievement of carrying out the first half-year and yearly national economic plans ahead of schedule.\nOur heroic working class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, scientists and technicians waged an unyielding struggle on the principle of giving priority to self-development to develop and manufacture new machines and equipment based on local efforts and technology, thereby presenting them as gifts to the Congress of the motherly Party. Others across the country wonderfully completed lots of major construction projects, which will be highly conducive to developing the economy and improving the people's living standards, in a short span of time before the Congress to send reports of loyalty to the Central Committee of the WPK.\nThose in the national defence science sector that played a magnificent prelude to this meaningful year with a thrilling explosion of Juche Korea's first hydrogen bomb went on to create momentous miracles in defending our national dignity and sovereignty, thus topping off the 70-day campaign and opening wide the door to the Seventh Congress of the WPK, full of pride in being victors.\nAll sectors and all units, burning their hearts with ardent loyalty to the WPK and extraordinary patriotic enthusiasm, sped up the grand revolutionary march to celebrate the Seventh Congress of the WPK as a glorious meeting of victors. This fully demonstrated the firm faith and will of our service personnel and people who are triumphantly building a thriving nation before the eyes of the world by smashing the hostile forces' vicious manoeuvres geared to sanctions and strangulation, and displayed to the world the indomitable spirit, daring grit and inexhaustible strength of heroic Korea.\nThe numerous eye-opening events that happened one after another in the run-up to the meaningful Congress of the WPK–all these achievements are permeated with the precious sweat, ardent passion and unassuming effort of the Party members who have always thrown in their lot with the WPK and adorned the golden age of socialist construction with uninterrupted revolutionary upsurges.\nI would like to extend heartfelt thanks and militant greetings, on behalf of the Central Committee of the WPK, to all the delegates, Party members, service personnel of the Korean People's Army and other people, who have adorned the sacred history of the WPK with hot blood and sweat of patriotism and made a great contribution to celebrating the Seventh Congress of the WPK as a meeting of victory and glory by clasping the weapons of revolution, hammer, sickle and writing brush with a burning conviction to travel one road for ever following our Party.\nOn the occasion of our Party's significant Congress my warm greetings go to the

Korea at the 7th Party Congress.\nThe period since the 6th Congress of the WPK has been an era of the severest struggle in its long history and years of glorious victories which have witnessed great changes, he said.\nHe referred to the fact that during the period under review signal victories were won in socialist construction and eternal foundations laid for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche thanks to the great Juche idea and Songun politics of the WPK and the devoted struggle waged by the army and people of the DPRK intensely loyal to the Party.\nHe said:\nThe WPK pushed forward with the work to model the whole Party and the entire army on the Juche idea and make all members of the society revolutionaries, working-class and intellectuals according to the programme of modelling the whole society on the Juche idea it had set forth at the 6th Congress, thereby consolidating the driving force of the socialist cause.\nIt set it as the strategic line to put the national economy on a Juche, modern and scientific basis and enlisted all the people in the struggle for implementing it, thus making notable progress in attaining the ten-point long-term goal of the socialist economic construction.\nThe WPK waged a courageous struggle to defend and advance the socialist cause with the firm will to shatter the imperialists' counter-revolutionary offensive with the revolutionary one.\nAt a time when our socialist cause advanced victoriously along the road of Juche under the rapidly changing situation and a bright prospect was opening up for national reunification, our Party and people suffered the greatest sudden loss to the nation, the demise of President Kim Il Sung whom they trusted and followed like Heaven. It was a bolt from the blue.\nThe death of the President was the biggest grief and loss to our Party and people and the harshest trial for our revolution.\nAfter the national mourning, the imperialists and their followers went to extremes in their political and military pressure, acts of provocation for war and economic blockade. They, coupled with severe natural disasters, caused untold hardships and trial in the economic construction and people's living.\nAt the time when the world was concerned about the fate of the DPRK and when the imperialist reactionaries were foolishly trumpeting about \"change in line\" and \"system collapse\", leader Kim Jong Il solemnly declared his iron will to invariably defend and carry forward the revolutionary cause of Juche started by the President no matter how arduous the journey of revolution might be, and wisely led the revolution and construction only as intended by the President and the way he did.\nBy carrying forward the cause of the President under the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il, the WPK firmly maintained the Songun revolutionary line, the path of winning the steady victory of the Korean revolution, and enforced Songun politics in an all-round way.\nThe WPK bolstered up the People's Army in every way, established state machinery centred on national defence and transformed and adjusted all fields on the principle of and in line with the requirements of Songun.\nThanks to the heroic struggle of the service personnel and people who turned out as one in close unity around the Party, the DPRK won victory after victory in the protracted fierce showdown with the imperialists and the US, victoriously concluded the Arduous March and forced march and honorably safeguarded the security and the sovereignty of the country and socialism.\nEven in the grim struggle for defending socialism, the WPK set itself a high goal of building a thriving socialist nation and waged a strenuous struggle, thus advancing the socialist cause to a new higher stage.\nAt a time when historic changes were taking place in accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche and Korean-style socialism was dynamically advancing along the road of victory indicated by Songun politics, our Party and people suffered another greatest loss to the nation all of a sudden—the demise of Kim Jong Il.\nAll the Party members, service personnel and other people, though grief-stricken over the loss of Kim Jong Il, overcame sorrow with strength and courage as befitting his soldiers and disciples and courageously turned out in the struggle to translate into a brilliant reality his lifetime plan and desire, closely united around the Party Central Committee.\nAt the 4th Conference of the WPK, it clarified the revolutionary faith and will to hold Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in high esteem as eternal leaders of our Party and the revolution and to uphold the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as the eternal guiding idea, and mobilize all the Party members and other people to carry out the instructions of the leaders.\nAs required by the prevailing situation and the developing revolution, the WPK advanced the strategic line of simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force and worked hard for its implementation.\nThanks to the dynamic struggle waged by the army and people of the DPRK to carry out the strategic line of the Party, a sure guarantee was provided for finally concluding the showdown with the imperialists and the US and hastening the final victory of our cause.\nThe WPK organized and waged an all-people general onward movement for building a thriving people's paradise as planned and desired by the great leaders and thus ushered in the new era of prosperity of the country.\nThe entire Party and all the people achieved the single-minded unity of the whole society around the leader in ideology and purpose and in a sense of moral obligation. This is the great success and feat achieved by our Party during the period under review.\nHolding fast to the strategic line of attaching importance to youth throughout the period of its revolutionary leadership, the WPK trained young people healthily to become successors to the revolution who carry forward the bloodline of Juche, thereby building the one and only youth power in the world.\nA spectacular success made by the WPK is that it implemented the Songun revolutionary line, the military line of self-defence, to turn the country into an invincible military power.\nThe WPK and the Korean people consolidated the material and technical foundations of the self-supporting national economy and provided a springboard for building an economic giant by waging the dynamic struggle to implement the strategic line of socialist economic construction.\nThe WPK successfully resolved theoretical and practical issues arising in carrying forward the revolutionary cause and faithfully inherited and developed the idea and cause of the leaders.\nKim Jong Un indicated the tasks and ways to be tackled in developing the Korean revolution onto a higher stage and accomplishing the cause of socialism by regarding the ideas and exploits of the great leaders as an eternal cornerstone.\nIt is necessary to model the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism in order to accomplish the socialist cause and completely achieve the independence of the masses of the people.\nA decisive turn should be brought about in the struggle to model the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism by stepping up the building of a thriving socialist nation to consolidate the position of the country as a political and military power and fly the flag of victory on the top of a mountain of a scientifically and technologically-advanced, economically-developed and highly-civilized power.\nIn order to successfully build a socialist power under the banner of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, it is necessary to strengthen the people's government and enhance its function and role and, at the same time, thoroughly implement the general line of our Party on vigorously conducting the three revolutions--ideological, technical and cultural.\nIt is imperative to carry through the five-year strategy for national economic development from 2016 to 2020.\nThe might of the politico-ideological power and military power should be further enhanced.\nAfter referring to the positive efforts the WPK made to reunify the country during the period under review, Kim Jong Un specified tasks to be tackled in achieving national reunification.\nThe WPK aroused all the Koreans to the struggle for national reunification on the basis of the idea and line on independent reunification and the proposal for founding a Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo put forward by Kim Il Sung.\nIn the crucible of the nationwide struggle for achieving the great national unity the Pan-National Alliance for Korea's Reunification was formed comprising broad sections of patriotic forces in the north, south and abroad, reunification-oriented events took place one after another to demonstrate the wisdom of the nation and the national reunification movement further developed into a nationwide one.\nThe noble patriotic will for reunification and bold decision of Kim Jong Il resulted in the two rounds of north-south summit for the first time in the history of national division and the adoption of the June 15 Joint Declaration and the October 4 Declaration, its action programme, whose kernel is the By-Our-Nation-Itself ideal. This was an epochal event that provided a historic milestone for independent reunification and marked a turning point in national reunification.\nThanks to the wise guidance of the great leaders, the cause of national reunification advanced along the track of national independence for decades in such a complicated situation that the separatist forces at home and abroad intensified their vicious moves, and the driving force of national reunification steadily built up to overpower the anti-reunification forces.\nThe three charters for national reunification in which the will and demands of all Koreans are embodied comprehensively and whose vitality was proved in practice should constantly be maintained to pave the road for reunification.\nNoting that in the period under review the DPRK boosted relations with other countries despite the persistent hostile policy of the US and its followers and their intensified moves to isolate and stifle it, Kim Jong Un set forth the tasks to be tackled in winning victory in the cause of global independence.\nIndependence, peace and friendship are the invariable ideals of the WPK’s foreign policy and the fundamental stand to be maintained in its efforts to achieve the cause of global independence.\nIt is the WPK's goal to build a peaceful world free from war and it is the consistent stand of the WPK and the DPRK government to struggle for peace and security in the region and the rest of the world.\nAs a responsible nuclear state, the DPRK will not use nuclear weapons first unless its sovereignty is encroached upon by any aggressive hostile forces with nukes, as it had already declared, and it will fulfil its commitments to nuclear non-proliferation and strive for the denuclearization of the world.\nThe WPK and the DPRK government will improve and normalize relations with those countries that respect the country’s sovereignty and are friendly towards it, though they had been hostile in the past.\nKim Jong Un noted that the WPK has developed into the great and dignified Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist party, breaking new ground in the building of a revolutionary party, and led the revolutionary cause of Juche along the road of shining victory.\nThe WPK should be strengthened into the eternal Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist party and its leadership role be steadily enhanced to successfully carry out the important tasks for accomplishing the socialist cause, the revolutionary cause of Juche under the banner of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, he stressed.\nHe called for rallying more closely around the Party Central Committee under the revolutionary banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and dynamically advancing forward toward bolstering the Party, accomplishing the socialist cause, and achieving the independent reunification of the country and the cause of global independence.\n"},{"title":"Second-day Sitting of Seventh Congress of WPK Held","body":"Second-day Sitting of Seventh

of Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League, which is held in the stirring period when young people across the country are expediting general onward march to implement the decisions of the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, is doing its work successfully, I warmly congratulate all the youth delegates attending this congress.\nI also extend warm thanks and militant greetings to young people across the country, who are working miracles and feats at the posts of national defence and at the sites of building a powerful socialist country and thus fulfilling their honourable mission and duty as the young vanguard of the Party.\nI congratulate the members of the overseas Korean youth delegations attending the congress, and offer my warm compatriotic greetings to the overseas young compatriots, including those in Japan, and the youth and students in south Korea who are struggling for the independent reunification of their motherland and the prosperity of their nation.\nThe Ninth Congress of Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League constitutes a landmark event in defending and adding eternal brilliance to the great Comrades Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's idea of and exploits in the youth movement and developing the youth league into invincible vanguard ranks as required by the new era.\nAs a reflection of the unanimous wish and desire of young people across the country, the congress has decided to rename the youth league Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League. This is a great event that laid an unshakeable cornerstone for developing the organization of our young people into a youth league of the great leaders for all ages; it is also a source of great honour and happiness for the youth league organizations and young people.\nThis is a congress of loyalty that has demonstrated the faith and will of the young vanguard to inherit and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche under the Party's leadership by carrying forward the glorious history and fighting traditions of the youth league, a congress for general onward march that has inspired young people to the grand struggle for building a powerful socialist country, and a historic congress that has set up a new milestone for the victorious advance of the Juche-oriented youth movement and the development of the youth league.\nDelegates,\nAs I stand on the platform in the venue of this meaningful congress, a watershed in the development of the Juche-oriented youth movement, I feel my heart filled with infinite gratitude to and reverence for the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and\nKim Jong Il who trained our young people to be splendid and reliable successors to the revolution and built the proud youth power.\nThe 70 years of the youth league is a history of brilliant victories of the great leaders' original idea of prioritizing young people and their wise leadership. It is also a history of the ardent loyalty and patriotic devotion with which the young people of Korea have supported the Party, the leader, the country and the people.\nHaving made a start of the youth movement early in the flames of the anti-Japanese revolution, Comrade Kim Il Sung expounded the Juche-oriented idea of the movement and guided it at its every step, lavishing great trust and affection on young people.\nBy dint of the line of prioritizing young people and his outstanding and seasoned leadership, Comrade Kim Jong Il developed the youth league into an organization that is unfailingly loyal to the Party and the leader and trained young people into reliable successors in carrying forward the lineage of Paektu, into warriors in accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche, thus opening a new heyday for the youth movement.\nThat they regarded prioritizing young people as the most important of all state affairs and made it a strategic revolutionary line in the whole course of leading the revolution, and, by wisely leading the implementation of the line, gave a perfect solution to the youth problem for the first time in history and built a youth power without parallel in the world is an outstanding exploit performed by our great leaders.\nIndeed, the youth movement of Korea is the glorious Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist youth movement pioneered and developed by dint of their great ideas and wise leadership, and ours is Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's youth power built thanks to their ennobling trust and affection.\nThe proud decades of victorious advance of the Juche-oriented youth movement are associated with the invaluable blood and sweat and heroic exploits of the young people who fought self-sacrificingly for the Party, the leader, the country and the people.\nThe first generation of the young people of our revolution took up arms following Comrade Kim Il Sung and fought the bloody anti-Japanese struggle, thus achieving the historic cause of national liberation. In the days of the fierce Fatherland Liberation War young people fought under the leadership of Comrade Kim Il Sung, dedicating even their youthful life without hesitation for their dear motherland, thus creating a miracle of heroic Korea in achieving victory in the war and defending with honour their motherland against the imperialists' aggression. In the arduous postwar days our young people, who were faithful to the call of the Party and the leader, performed brilliant feats of labour in reconstruction, and stormed ahead in the spirit of Chollima, thus working a miracle of heroic Korea of building in a short period a socialist state that is independent, self-supporting and self-reliant in defence.\nIn the trying days of the anti-imperialist, anti-US showdown that would decide the destiny of socialism, our young people stood in the vanguard of supporting the Songun-based revolutionary leadership of General Kim Jong Il, thus safeguarding the lifeline of the Juche revolution and socialist country death-defyingly, overcoming the hardships and trials and opening an era of making a turn in building a powerful socialist country.\nIn the new era of the Juche revolution our young people, with the faith and courage that they can lift even the earth when they are trusted by the Party, built the marvellous Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station through a fierce struggle with nature, thus creating the legendary tale of heroic youth and demonstrating to the full the heroic mettle of the young vanguard of the new generation educated and trained by our Party. The Paektusan hero youth spirit displayed by the Paektu youth is the revolutionary spirit of defending the Party Central Committee and implementing its policies to the death and the offensive-oriented, revolutionary spirit symbolic of our present era.\nTheir heroic struggle for and exploits in steadfastly defending the Party, the leader and the country and powerfully propelling socialist construction through generations on the sacred revolutionary road will shine for ever in the annals of our Party and of building the Juche-oriented youth power.\nIn the gigantic and worthwhile struggle for achieving the country's prosperity and people's happiness, our young people have been educated in a revolutionary way and trained spiritually and physically, and have developed into a large, matchless contingent forming a thousand-fold, tens-of-thousand-fold fortress around the Party.\nOur young people are patriots and heroes whom we can be proud of before the world; that they have a large contingent of such trustworthy young people is a great blessing for the Workers' Party of Korea and a source of pride for Korea, and this assures the great strength of our dignified state and its bright future.\nI pay tribute to the young people of the preceding generations, who dedicated their one and only valuable youth to the sacred cause for the Party, the revolution, the country and the people, and extend once again, on behalf of the Workers' Party of Korea, warm, militant greetings to the young people across the country, who are performing shining youthful exploits in translating the Party's plans and intentions into reality.\nDelegates,\nToday the youth league is faced with the heavy yet honourable task for ushering in a golden age of the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist youth movement by developing itself into the eternal youth organization of the great leaders as required by the new era of the Juche revolution and displaying its might as the Party's advance force and wing in the efforts for implementing the decisions adopted at the Seventh Congress of the Party.\nIf the youth league is to fulfil the sacred mission and duty it has assumed for the times and the revolution, it should model itself on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\nModelling the youth league on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism means holding up the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il as eternal leaders and advancing the Juche-oriented youth movement victoriously guided by their revolutionary ideology.\nThis is a mature demand of our developing revolution and youth movement which have reached a new high, and the militant banner the youth league must hold fast to in the struggle to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche.\nYoung people are the successors to the Juche revolution, and the youth league is a reliable reserve force of our Party. The future of the Party and revolution and the destiny of the country and nation depend largely on the role they play, and the youth league shoulders an important task to perform in implementing our Party's programme of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\nThe great General Kim Jong Il said early that the youth league, together with the Party and the army, has an important role to play in the revolutionary struggle, and that we have nothing to fear if the Party, the army and the youth league are strong. When the youth league, together with the Party and the army, is modelled on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism true to the General's ideas on the Party, the army and the youth league, the might of our revolutionary ranks will be increased to the maximum. Modelling the entire youth league as well as the entire Party and the entire army on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is the path our revolution should follow and the basic guarantee for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche.\nThe youth league should safeguard and add brilliance to the great leaders' idea of and leadership exploits in the youth movement, and establish the Party's unified leadership system within itself thoroughly, holding aloft the banner of modelling itself on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\nIt should ensure that all its officials and other young people devote loyalty of the highest degree to upholding Comrades\nKim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il as eternal leaders. It should take the great leaders' idea of the youth movement as the banner of victory for the youth movement, a fundamental guideline for strengthening itself, and should ensure that all its undertakings are geared to safeguarding the leaders' idea and leadership exploits and death-defyingly implementing the instructions they gave in their lifetime.\nIt should constantly intensify the work of establishing the Party's unified leadership system as demanded by the period of making a leap forward in implementing the revolutionary cause of Juche, and establish strict discipline and order whereby all matters arising in its building and activities are dealt with according to the unified conclusion of the Party Central Committee and the Party's decisions and directives are conveyed and disseminated in time from its Central Committee to its lowest echelons and carried out immediately.\nIt should hold fast to ideological education among young people as its main task and fully prepare all of them as genuine Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists.\nThe youth league is an organization for ideological education, and its basic duty is to conduct ideological education of young people. If the youth league organizations neglect their basic duty of conducting ideological education of their members, busying themselves with ceremonial events or economic and other business-like affairs, they cannot prepare young people to be stout successors to the revolution. This will result in shaking the foundation of the youth work and making the youth league itself inviable.\nThe ultimate objective in educating young people is to train all of them into genuine Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists.\nOur Party's revolutionary ideology and the revolutionary spirit of Paektu provide essential nourishment for doing so. The youth league should implant the Juche idea, our Party's revolutionary ideology, and the revolutionary spirit of Paektu deep in the minds of all our young people. By doing so, it should train them to be strong in ideas and faith and ready to fight staunchly in the spirit of self-development with loyalty to the Party's cause, and ensure that all the places where they live and work seethe with the soul and mettle of Paektu.\nThe youth league organizations at all levels should hold fast to the five-point education put forward by the Party, regarding it as what constitutes the major contents of the ideological education geared to training young people into Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists, and conduct it effectively by making use of all forms and occasions of the ideological education work.\nThey should lay great stress on educating young people in the greatness of our leaders with the aim of preparing them as the young vanguard unfailingly faithful to the Party and the leaders. They should also step up education of young people in\nKim Jong Il's patriotism, revolutionary faith, anti-imperialist and class consciousness, and socialist morality, so that all of them become true patriots with ardent love for their country, hot-blooded fighters with indomitable revolutionary faith and unwavering anti-imperialist and class consciousness, staunch champions of the class struggle and cultured social beings with a high degree of cultural attainments and ennobling moral traits.\nThey should effectively run the education system including study sessions and lectures and raise its efficiency to the highest possible level. In this way they can make sure that wherever there are young people, the Party's intentions are given uninterrupted publicity and they imbibe our Party's revolutionary ideology all the time, just as they breathe fresh air.\nThey should conduct education of young people in a novel and aggressive way as suited to their characteristic features. They should decisively eliminate the tendency towards emphasizing how many times the ideological education work is done or following any set formula in conducting it. Instead, they should adopt a novel, energetic and militant approach towards this work, in conformity with the characteristics of young people and the requirements of the times. They should strive hard to find and use sincere and highly effective methods of education that will inspire the masses of young people with youthful vigour.\nThe youth league organizations and young people should become the vanguard and shock brigade in building a powerful socialist country.\nTo build a powerful socialist country is a sacred cause of developing the country into a mighty socialist state, a prospering people's paradise, according to the plans of the great leaders and the Party. To achieve breakthroughs in the vanguard of the struggle to this end is the basic duty proper to our young people who make up the Party's militant reserve and the most vigorous of our social forces.\nAll our young people, upholding the militant tasks advanced by the Seventh Congress of the Party, should honour their valuable title of heroic youth in our era, in the worthwhile struggle to build a powerful socialist country.\n\"Let us fully demonstrate the resourcefulness and gallantry of the heroic youth in the general offensive for building a powerful socialist country!\"-this is the militant slogan the youth league and young people should hold high in the present times.\nYoung people should be the death-defying corps in the struggle to defend their socialist country, faithfully supporting our Party's Songun-based revolutionary leadership.\nThey are the advance force in carrying out the Songun revolution and the main force in safeguarding the country. All of them, bearing in mind our Party's idea of prioritizing arms, should regard national defence as their most sacred duty and the highest expression of patriotism, and valiantly turn out in the struggle to defend the socialist country. The young service personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Korean People's Internal Security Forces, as befit the combatants defending the outposts of the anti-imperialist military front, the lifeline of our revolution, should firmly grasp the weapons of the revolution and the class and safeguard the defence lines of the country and its socialist system. At any time in the future we will surely confront the US imperialists, the sworn enemy of our people; they should create a new miracle of achieving victory in this life-or-death showdown.\nYouth and students should all cultivate ardent patriotism and a staunch spirit of defending the country, and take part in military training with a sincere attitude. In times of emergency they should take up arms and turn out as one in the all-people resistance to defend their beloved country, native homes and workplaces against the aggression of the enemy and their destructive and subversive moves.\nThe struggle to defend socialism is a military showdown with the enemy; at the same time it is a confrontation in ideology and spirit. Today imperialists and reactionaries, setting our young people of a new generation as their target, are resorting to vicious schemes in trying to deprave and corrupt them and undermine our socialism from within.\nAll our young people should resolutely counter the enemy's schemes for ideological and cultural infiltration with great ideological and mental strength and unshakeable revolutionary faith, and take a tough stand to prevent any alien ideology and culture and unnatural lifestyle from penetrating our interior. The youth league organizations should intensify ideological education and ideological struggle among young people, so as to root out, at the first signs, any poisonous elements of non-socialist and alien practices appearing in the garden of our style of socialism.\nOur country, now developing by leaps and bounds, calls on young people to strive for the building of a powerful socialist country. The vibrant sites where the Mallima speed is being created in a race against time, are theatres of activity for our hot-blooded young people.\nThey should uphold the self-development-first banner on all fronts for building a powerful socialist country and display their valiant offensive spirit and youthful courage in achieving new miraculous and innovative successes one after another.\nIn implementing the Five-Year Strategy for National Economic Development they should raise fierce flames for collective competition, thereby setting new standards and new records and overfulfilling their daily, monthly and quarterly quotas for the national economic plan.\nThe youth league organizations should push ahead with the Songun Youth Torch Prize movement, the youth shock brigade movement and other mass movements, the advantages and vitality of which have been confirmed in practice. They should launch vigorous campaigns in which one overtakes and learns from others and swaps experiences with them, and raise fierce flames for performing great exploits. Then new miraculous and innovative achievements will be made wherever young people are working, and youthful vigour will pervade the entire country.\nThe youth league should carry out with credit major construction projects that will make a significant contribution to developing the economy and improving the people's living standards, fully demonstrating the might of youth shock brigade. The Party Central Committee is planning to place the youth shock brigades, along with the construction units of the People's Army, in the vanguard of the struggle to usher in a great golden age of construction. Young people should display the courage and spirit of moving mountains and filling up seas at a go at the sites of grand socialist construction in answer to the Party's appeal, building on this land larger numbers of monumental structures that are named in honour of them.\nThe more vigorously young people advance in response to the Party's call demonstrating the might of the youth construction units, the more vibrantly the entire country will be seething and the greater progress will be made in implementing the cause of building a powerful socialist country.\nYoung people should become the vanguard and pioneer in building a sci-tech power.\nIn the present era of science and technology the competition of national strength is precisely the one of science and technology, and the future of our prosperous country depends on how hard our young people are striving, who are sensitive to the new and overflowing with creative wisdom and verve. They should stand in the vanguard of the competitions of the mind and of technologies to build a sci-tech power and glorify the days of their youth with valuable creations and feats, so as to bring forward the future of their prosperous country.\nYoung scientists and technicians, keeping their feet firmly planted on this land and looking out over the world, should devote their creative wisdom and enthusiasm to the campaign to surpass the cutting edge, with a view to raising our country to the status of a sci-tech power as soon as possible. Young people should take the lead in making all the people well-versed in science and technology, and become masters of invention and technical innovation, rendering a positive contribution to modernizing the production lines and ensuring the domestic production of raw materials, fuel and equipment. Students should learn hard and accumulate knowledge, always holding books in their hands, and thus prepare themselves to contribute to promoting national prosperity by developing cutting-edge science and technology.\nYoung people should become creators of socialist civilization and the vanguard in building a civilized power.\nThey should play the core, vanguard role in building our country into a civilized socialist power as soon as possible by developing art and literature, sports and all other sectors of socialist culture in a comprehensive way.\nAll of them, cherishing national pride and self-confidence that our own culture and lifestyle are the best, should hold dear all tangible and intangible heritage achieved by the preceding generations, and add lustre to our style of socialist culture. As demanded by the era when the general offensive for building a powerful socialist country is gaining momentum, they should bring the culture of heroic youth into full blossom and make the songs of revolution and struggle resound wherever they live and work.\nThey should make strenuous efforts to tighten moral discipline. They should all respect their revolutionary forerunners, teachers and seniors, promote communal unity and family harmony, and observe public morality and order of life on a voluntary basis.\nThey should contribute to economic construction and defence building with a sturdy physique developed amid the wind of mass-based sports and defence sports, and take the lead in turning the whole country into a socialist fairyland.\nThey should wage a proactive struggle to achieve the independent reunification of the country and global independence.\nIt is the young people, the sons and daughters of the nation and the future of the country, who ought to stand in the vanguard of the effort to accomplish the great national cause of putting an end to the long-standing suffering of national division and building on this land a dignified and prosperous reunified country.\nAll the Korean young people in the north, in the south and abroad should hold aloft the banner of national independence and great national unity, join their minds and purposes on the patriotic road of reunification and fight in solidarity and collaboration. In this way, they can smash the obstructive moves of the US imperialists and other anti-reunification forces and open up a broad avenue to national reunification.\nHolding high the three charters for national reunification, the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the October 4 Declaration, provided by the great leaders, as grand programmes for national reunification, the youth league and young people should stand in the vanguard of the struggle for the independent reunification of the country and render positive support and encouragement to the struggle of the youth and students in south Korea for anti-US independence and national reunification and to the patriotic struggle of the overseas young compatriots.\nThe youth and students in the south should wage a dynamic struggle to thwart the moves of the United States and its followers for aggression and war, who are attempting to bring a nuclear holocaust to our nation, and to have the historic agreements common to the nation respected and implemented. By doing so, they can open up a new phase for the development of inter-Korean relations and national reunification.\nThose in Japan and other overseas Korean young people should, with pride and self-respect of being members of the dignified Korean nation, render characteristic contributions to the patriotic cause for the independent reunification of their country and prosperity of their socialist motherland.\nThe youth movement of Korea is closely related to the world youth movement, and the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League is faced with an important task for contributing to securing genuine international justice and realizing the cause of global independence by strengthening unity and cooperation under the unfurled banner of anti-imperialist independence with the progressive young peoples of the world, who champion independence.\nThe youth league should apply the idea and principles of our Party's foreign policy to cementing anti-imperialist solidarity, friendship and unity with the world's progressive young peoples and proactively contributing to the development of the world youth movement. It should be a good example and the vanguard in the struggle of the young peoples to achieve independence and justice, and make dynamic headway, demonstrating to the whole world the might of the Juche-oriented youth power.\nIn order to usher in a golden age in the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist youth movement, the youth league should strengthen its organizations and enhance their militant functions and role in every way possible.\nThe youth league is a political organization that trains young people to be a reserve force of the Party and successors to the revolutionary cause of Juche; it is in direct charge of the youth movement. Only when its organizations are powerful and their militant might is displayed to the full can they advance the youth movement vigorously true to the Party's ideas and intentions.\nIt should launch a strong drive for strengthening its organizations so as to ensure that its organizations at all levels are developed into those strong in organization, discipline, unity and fighting capability, into elite youth ranks.\nA revolutionary work system and discipline should be established across the youth league organizations.\nIt should establish a well-regulated work system and order by which its organizations at all levels carry out its decisions and directives for implementing the Party's policies and report the results promptly and organizations at higher echelons keep up-to-date with the activities of their subordinate ones and take appropriate measures. It should establish strict discipline across itself, from its Central Committee down to its primary organizations, by which all their undertakings are conducted as required by the Party's policies and the Rules of the youth league.\nThe major link in the whole chain of the efforts for developing the youth league is to strengthen its primary organizations, which are its grass-roots organizations and basic combat units. The youth league committees at all levels should go down to the primary organizations on a regular basis, improve the qualifications and capabilities of the primary officials and help them in a responsible way so that the officials can work with the youth league members effectively. In particular, city and county youth league committees, the guidance units at the lowest level, should properly get acquainted with the work of their primary organizations, effectively guide them and give them positive help.\nYouth league organizations should intensify the organizational life of their members so as to ensure that this life is turned into a course of a school in which they are educated and trained in a revolutionary way.\nThe organizational life in the youth league is worthwhile and valuable political life for young people to add lustre to their political integrity as befits the members of the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League.\nThe youth league organizations should establish a revolutionary climate of organizational life among their members, so as to encourage them all to treasure their organizations as a parent body of their political integrity and take a voluntary part in their organizational life. They should put the organizational life on a regular footing and establish strict organizational discipline to ensure that no young men and women take part in their organizational life lackadaisically or live divorced from their organizations. They should bring the organizational life close to fulfilling revolutionary tasks, ensuring that the outcome of the former is expressed in the latter.\nThe youth league should direct great efforts to strengthening the organizations of the Children's Union, its successor, and educating the union members properly.\nChildren's Union members are pillars who will shoulder the future of our country, and strengthening the Children's Union is an important task entrusted to the youth league.\nWhat the enemy fear most is that the lineage of our revolution is being steadily carried forward. Youth league committees at all levels should regard guidance over the work of the Children's Union as one of their tasks, and ensure that school education, family education and social education are closely linked for educating the Children's Union members. In this way they can prepare all the members and organizations of the Children's Union to be the children's vanguard faithful to our Party.\nIt is important to build up the ranks of the youth league officials and further enhance their sense of responsibility and role.\nWhether or not the work of the youth league is correctly carried on as intended by the Party depends entirely on the role of officials of the youth league, masters of youth work. When they become the engine and skilful political workers that guide young people to always advance straight ahead and with vigour following the Party, the five-million-strong youth ranks can become a steel-like vanguard unit without any duds.\nThe youth league, to suit the realities in which one generation of its officials is continuously being replaced by another, should replenish and renew in time these ranks with the hard-core young people who are politically and ideologically sound and have been trained in the practical struggle. It should channel great efforts into training its reserve officials.\nAll the youth league officials should be well aware of their tasks in the struggle to usher in a golden age of the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist youth movement, and execute them creditably.\nThey should become fervent advocates, active disseminators and thorough implementers of the great leaders' and Party's idea and line of prioritizing young people.\nThey should equip themselves fully with this idea and line, carry on youth work on the basis of the leaders' instructions and the Party's idea, and implement the Party's policy of youth work to the death.\nThey should become dedicated fighters, infinite enthusiasts and persevering men of action, who are ready to devote heart and soul to developing the work of the youth league.\nThey should always have the development of the league's work under their consideration and devote their wisdom and passion to achieving it, and organize and carry on the work in a fresh and innovative way with unyielding fortitude and enterprising work style. They should arrange all undertakings in a way big enough to make the youthful hearts beat high, and whatever they do, they should give a strong push to it with unshakeable courage and stamina that they will finish it, come what may, and bring it to fruition without fail.\nThey should become the standard-bearers in the struggle, standing in the vanguard of the ranks to make breakthroughs on the advance, and models of rank-and-file members in all aspects.\nThey should immerse themselves in the seething workplaces, tackle difficult and labour-consuming work ahead of others, and influence their members in practice, not in words, to arouse them to struggle and achieve feats. They should be a good example for the members to emulate in implementing the revolutionary tasks and conducting the organizational life, and be simple, modest and upright in everyday life.\nThey should become dear \"elder brothers\" and \"elder sisters\" of the members who love and look after them as they would do their own flesh and blood and share weal and woe with them.\nWith fervent comradeship, they should take responsible care of the political integrity of their members and share sorrow and joy with them. They should work devotedly and selflessly for the good of their members and help and lead all of them to advance straight ahead following the Party without any laggard.\nThey should be all-round and versatile men, who know much and are possessed of high organizing ability, vigour of activity and rich cultural attainments.\nBy studying hard and by making strenuous efforts they should acquire knowledge in various fields, become proficient in the practical work of the youth league, and acquire the methods and best way of educating and enlisting the members. They should be good at singing, dancing and making motivational speeches.\nParty guidance over the work of the youth league should be further improved.\nThe work with young people is part of Party work, and positively helping the youth league in its work and leading it along the right path is an important task of the organizations and officials of the Party.\nThey should bear in mind the intention of the Party Central Committee to prioritize the work with young people and intensify their policy-oriented guidance and political leadership in order to ensure that the work of the youth league in their respective regions and units is conducted properly in line with the Party's ideas and intentions.\nThey should spare no efforts for the education of young people, love and treat them in an unbiased manner with scrupulous maternal affection, and take good care of them in their work and life.\nParticular concern should be directed to the work with the youth league officials.\nThe organizations and officials of the Party should educate them in a responsible way and provide them with good working conditions so that they can focus on the work with young people. They should admit exemplary youth league officials into the Party and appoint them as Party officials on a preferential basis, so as to ensure that all the officials of the youth league feel great honour and pride and devote all their wisdom and passion to its work.\nA Party-wide campaign should be launched to create model, exemplary units in Party guidance over the work of the youth league and generalize their experience so as to make sure that loving young people and rendering positive support to the work of the youth league becomes a trait of the Workers' Party of Korea.\nThe climate of prioritizing and loving young people should pervade the whole country.\nThe work with youth and children is an undertaking of overriding importance that has a bearing on the future of our Party, our state and our style of socialism, and training them should be the concern of the whole country and all the people. Not only Party officials but all other officials and working people should become educators and parents of youth and children, properly educating them and actively assisting in resolving the problems concerning the work with them. Then our young people of a new generation will grow into dependable successors to the revolution under the guidance and with the help of the whole country and the whole society.\nDelegates,\nA broad vista is open before the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League and our young people storming ahead along the course of the Korean revolution indicated by the Party Central Committee, and the eternal brilliant future of the youth movement of Korea is assured.\nLet us all struggle dynamically for the accomplishment of the Juche-oriented socialist cause, for the modelling of the youth league on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and towards the bright future of the youth power.\nGlory to our resourceful, heroic and trustworthy five-million-strong young vanguard!\n"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Has Photo Session with Participants in Ninth Congress of Youth League","body":"Kim Jong Un Has Photo Session with Participants in Ninth Congress of Youth League\n \nKim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, had a photo session with the participants in the Ninth Congress of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League.\nWhen he appeared at the photographing venue, stormy cheers \"hurrah!\" burst forth.\nHe extended warm salute to the enthusiastically cheering participants.\nYoung man and woman, on behalf of the participants in the congress, presented bunches of flowers to him in reflection of boundless reverence and best wishes of all youth across the country for him.\nHe once again warmly congratulated the participants and had a photo session with them.\nHe expressed belief that all the participants in the congress would develop the youth league into the eternal youth league of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il under the uplifted banner of great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and successfully perform their mission and duty as reserves, advance force and wing of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) in the van of creating the Mallima speed for carrying out the decision of the Seventh Congress of the WPK.\nPresent there were Choe Ryong Hae, Kim Su Gil, Kim Nung O, Pak Thae Song and Ri Il Hwan, department director of the Central Committee of the WPK, Jon Yong Nam, first secretary of the Central Committee of the youth league, Kim Yong Ju, head of a delegation of the Korean Youth League in Japan, and Kim Yong Nyo, head of a delegation of Federation of Young Korean Nationals in China.\nPolitical News Team\n"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Has Photo Session with Contributors to Successful Test-fire of SLBM","body":"Kim Jong Un Has Photo Session with Contributors to Successful Test-fire of SLBM\n \nKim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, had a photo session with the members who contributed to the successful underwater test-fire of strategic submarine ballistic missile.\nWhen he appeared at the photographing venue, stormy cheers \"hurrah!\" burst forth.\nThe participants warmly welcomed him, extending great thanks to him who credited them with making the successful test-fire though he visited the test-fire ground more than ten times for the discussion on the issue of manufacturing the Korean-style powerful strategic submarine and ballistic missile and made total dedication and tireless and sincere efforts for doing so.\nHe extended warm salute to the enthusiastically cheering participants.\nHe warmly congratulated the scientists, technicians, workers and officials in the field of national defense and had a photo session with them.\nHe expressed belief that the participants would fulfill their mission and duty in consolidating the arsenal of Songun revolution and turning the DPRK into a matchless military power, rocket power by giving full play to their indefatigable mental power and tremendous might.\nPresent there were Ri Man Gon, Ri Pyong Chol and No Kwang Chol.\nPolitical News Team\n"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Guides Fire Drill of Ballistic Rockets","body":"Kim Jong Un Guides Fire Drill of Ballistic Rockets\n \nKim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army(KPA), provided field guidance to the fire drill of ballistic rockets by Hwasong artillery units of the KPA Strategic Force.\nHwasong artillery units of the KPA Strategic Force were involved in the drill.

The founding of this university marked the beginning of a new history of a Juche-based and people-oriented higher education for training the people's sons and daughters into dependable pillars of a new Korea, into native cadres, and it opened a wide road for building a prosperous and independent people's state by relying on our native cadres.\nIn every period and at every stage of the revolution and construction, including the difficult days of building a new country and the trying days of the Fatherland Liberation War, Comrade Kim Il Sung indicated the road the university should follow and led it at every step so that it could train a large number of excellent native cadres demanded by the Party and the revolution. Thanks to his wise leadership and uncommon care, a solid foundation was laid for developing it into a model university in training talented revolutionaries and the Ryongnam Hill area into a world-class university area.\nComrade Kim Jong Il, always with close concern for the work of the university, wisely led it so that it could creditably perform the mission and tasks it had assumed for the times and the revolution.\nHaving made a historic determination on Ryongnam Hill in his early days, he energetically led the university to establish the Juche orientation in its educational work, and had it developed into the university of Comrade Kim Il Sung, whose lifeblood is faithfulness to the leader, and into the highest institute of Juche-based science and education. Etched in the hearts of our people including the teaching staff and students of the university is the august image of the great General, who unfolded the plan of building it into one of the most prestigious universities in the world and, despite the mental and physical fatigue accumulated on the road of the Songun revolution, put his heart and soul into creating world-standard educational conditions and environment for the university.\nThe great leaders were, indeed, founders and builders of the university and benevolent fathers and mentors of its teaching staff and students, and the university is the university of the leaders both in name and in reality, which was born and developed under their warm care.\nThere are many famous universities in the world proud of their long history and time-honoured traditions, but Kim Il Sung University is the only one that is glorious with the great name of the Sun revered by the world and is brilliant with the imperishable leadership exploits of the national leaders.\nOur Party pays close concern to defending and honouring for all ages the imperishable revolutionary exploits performed by the great leaders for the development of the university and to further developing it into a most prestigious university in line with the requirements of the times and the developing revolution.\nSince its founding, the university has played the pivotal role in training national cadres and developing the country's science and technology under the leadership of the great leaders and the Party.\nIn line with the Party's education policy, the educationists and scientists of the university have trained a great number of talented revolutionaries, politically and ideologically sound and scientifically and technologically prepared; they have also proved the validity of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and Party policy, given wide publicity to them and wonderfully resolved the scientific and technological problems arising in developing the economy and culture and in consolidating the national defence capability, thus making a positive contribution to victoriously advancing the revolutionary cause of Juche.\nIn every grim decade of our revolution its students have defended the Party and the leaders staunchly and stood in the vanguard of death-defyingly executing the Party's plans and intentions.\nIts graduates, cherishing the great political trust and expectation of the Party and the leaders, have worked with devotion for the development of our Party and Republic, and are now performing their responsibilities and basic duty as the core of the Party and the revolution, as the vanguard fighters, at the major sites of the construction of a powerful socialist country.\nInvariably following the Party with a single mind along the road of loyalty and patriotism, the university has produced the dependable hard core of the Party and the state and many competent specialists in several fields, who will creditably carry forward the revolutionary cause of Juche to completion, and forcefully propelled the building of a powerful socialist country by achieving fruitful results in scientific research. This constitutes an outstanding exploit the university has performed for the country and the revolution.\nWhile striving hard to implement the instructions the great leaders gave in their lifetime, the university has trained excellent educational and scientific personnel including academicians, professors and doctors, particularly young scientists of a new generation who have won recognition from the world scientific circles; colleges, faculties and departments have been incorporated into it as appropriate to the appearance of a university; educational equipment have been upgraded and put on a highly IT footing, and well-equipped bases built for manufacturing cutting-edge products. In this way foundations have been laid for building it up into one of the most prestigious universities in the world.\nToday the Ryongnam Hill area has been turned into a large university area centred on the bronze statues of Comrades\nKim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. A witness to history that comprehends the great leaders' imperishable exploits for developing the Juche-oriented education and science and building a thriving country and eloquently proves the validity of our Party's idea and line of prioritizing education and talents, the area shines brilliantly as the sacred place where the dawn of final victory in the Juche revolution is being ushered in.\nOn behalf of the Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the Republic I extend warm thanks to all the teaching staff, students and graduates of Kim Il Sung University who, fully conscious of their heavy responsibility and mission for the Party and the revolution, the country and the people, have displayed lofty loyalty and patriotic devotion over the past seven decades, rendering great services to developing the university and implementing the revolutionary cause of Juche.\nToday the university is faced with an ennobling task for making a positive contribution to carrying out the cause of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism by training a greater number of talented revolutionaries who are faithful to the Party and the revolution and have high practical abilities and forcefully propelling the building of a powerful socialist country with successful research results in cutting-edge science as demanded by the new era of the Juche revolution.\nIn order for the university to creditably perform the mission and duty it has assumed for the times and the revolution, it should be developed into the university of the great leaders for all ages.\nTo ensure that it invariably maintains its revolutionary character and original features as the university of the leaders and develop it into the university of the great leaders that keeps up its prestige in the eyes of the world–this is the general direction for building up Kim Il Sung University in the new era of the Juche revolution.\nThe university should be steadfast in defending its proud history and tradition of regarding loyalty to the Party and the leader as its lifeblood, and glorify them generation after generation and century after century.\nThe great leaders' undying exploits and instructions are the lasting foundation and guideline for building up Kim Il Sung University. The university should maintain the great leaders' Juche-oriented ideas, theories and instructions on education as its permanent programme and apply them to its overall work in a thoroughgoing way, thus realizing the leaders' plan and desire for making it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.\nLoyalty to the Party's ideology and leadership is the lifeblood of Kim Il Sung University. The university should intensify the work of establishing the Party's unified leadership system to turn itself into a crystallization of conviction and loyalty, with which it faithfully supports the Party's ideology and leadership and keeps pace with the Party Central Committee all the time. By steadily carrying forward its glorious tradition as the university of the great leaders, it should ensure that the whole campus overflows with the revolutionary spirit of defending the Party Central Committee and implementing Party policy to the death.\nIt is essential to develop it into one of the most prestigious universities in the world as befits the dignified, revolutionary university of the great leaders.\nAn important task for doing so is to bring education in close combination with scientific research and put the main emphasis on training creative talents and developing cutting-edge scientific theories and technologies.\nThe university should improve the content of education, teaching methods, education system and management of teaching in conformity with the characteristics of the most prestigious universities.\nIt should do so by setting clear-cut objectives for training talents at all the educational stages, ranging from regular and postgraduate courses to research institutes.\nWhile prioritizing political and ideological subjects, it should improve the teaching of other subjects by adhering to Party policy and encouraging theoretical explanation in plain language, so as to fully guarantee the politico-ideological character of the content of education. It should make an overall review of the teaching programmes for all subjects and update them on the principle of ensuring their practicability, comprehensiveness and modernity, and compile world-class textbooks in our own way.\nKim Il Sung University should set an example for all other universities of the country to follow in introducing innovative teaching methods.\nIt should train the students into positive learners and explorers by developing and perfecting the heuristic teaching method of our style in line with the requirements of the times, and conduct education in close combination with scientific research and practical activities. It should create processes, means, methods and forms of teaching to suit the realities of our country and the characteristic features of relevant subjects, and actively apply them. It is important to proactively enlist the students in the regular course as well as the postgraduate course in scientific research, increase the proportion of experiments, internships and skills training in the direction of improving their application abilities, and set up a scientific method of evaluating the practical abilities of the students with a focus on their application abilities.\nIt should organize teaching units in a reasonable way, and ensure that the students receive lectures from top-notch teachers in the university or the country through various forms and methods of education. It should properly fix the hours of teaching by teachers, making it a principle that highly-qualified, authoritative teachers and researchers give main lectures on their subjects.\nThe education system, management of teaching and educational administration should be improved.\nIt should establish a well-regulated continuous education system, ranging from regular course to postgraduate course, and ensure that the genius education system set up by General Kim Jong Il pays off in practice.\nIn conformity with its character as a university, it should develop new colleges, faculties and departments for training personnel talented in cutting-edge and other major fields like aerospace technology and chemical industry, and develop new branches of cross-disciplinary sciences in line with the trend of the comprehensive development of science and the demands of the country's socio-economic development, and bring up outstanding talents for these fields.\nThe university should develop its faculties and departments with a certain level of foundations and attainments so that they can become capable of securing world supremacy, and launch a dynamic campaign in which one overtakes and learns from others so as to increase the ranks of such faculties and departments.\nA rational system and order for educational administration should be established on the principle of ensuring smooth progress of teaching and scientific research by teachers and researchers, and of edification of students.\nDepartments should be strengthened into academic centres of relevant sectors, into authoritative research units, in which teaching is closely combined with scientific research.\nKim Il Sung University should build up its distance education college into a nationwide online educational base of social sciences and increase the number of its courses and students to develop it into a large-scale college, thus making a tangible contribution to implementing our Party's policy of making all the people well-versed in science and technology.\nThe university should adopt decisive steps to strengthen the forces of science and education that are capable of building itself up into a most prestigious university.\nThe main forces, who are directly responsible for doing so, are its forces of science and education centred on teachers and researchers.\nThe university should train on a long-term basis reserve scientists and educationists for every discipline to strengthen these forces in terms of both quality and quantity, and ensure that their lineage is carried forward stoutly. It should direct its great efforts to the work of the institutes of social and natural sciences so as to ensure that their research fellows achieve outstanding successes in their research projects in cutting-edge branches and, in this course, grow to be world-class scholars.\nThe university should vigorously conduct scientific research and become a pacesetter in realizing the integration of education, scientific research and production.\nIn scientific research, it should focus on satisfactorily resolving the theoretical and practical, scientific and technological problems arising in building a powerful socialist country, developing the sector of basic sciences and pushing back the frontiers of science and technology.\nThe sector of social sciences should add eternal glory to the immortal revolutionary careers and achievements of the great leaders, and explain and verify the originality, truthfulness, veracity and vitality of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and the Party's lines and policies in a deep-going way and give wide publicity to them. The sector of natural sciences should make a positive contribution to solving the scientific and technological problems including those related with food and energy that are urgently needed in developing the national economy and consolidating the national defence capability. The sectors of basic sciences and cutting-edge science and technology should present research results with a world competitive edge.\nWhat is important in building the university into a most prestigious one is to achieve the integration of education, scientific research and production.\nTrue to the instructions Comrade Kim Jong Il gave in his lifetime, the university should consolidate the successes it gained in building the bases for conducting research into cutting-edge technology and developing intellectual products, and at the same time, build more of such bases and update technical service, so as to proactively apply them to education, and contribute to setting up cutting-edge industries in the country.\nIt should push ahead purposefully with the work of building itself up as a hub of international academic exchange.\nThe university should regularly organize international academic seminars by discipline or of a comprehensive nature, and expand joint research with prestigious universities and research institutes in other countries.\nIt should ensure that its excellent academic papers are presented to authoritative international seminars and contributed to international academic journals. The Bulletin of Kim Il Sung University should be designated as a specialized academic periodical of the country and developed into a world-famous one. The bulletin and books of the university including textbooks and reference books should be edited to be weighty, so that they can be used in other countries as well as in itself and throughout our country.\nIt should enrol many foreign students and give them regular, postgraduate and internship courses in Korean and other special disciplines; it should also send its students, postgraduates in particular, abroad for further education.\nIts teachers and researchers should decisively enhance their sense of responsibility and role, and its students should heighten their zeal for learning.\nThe teachers and researchers are career revolutionaries training the hard core of the revolution and world-level talents. Today, when the university is charging forward to beat the world, they have assumed a very heavy responsibility and duty for the Party and the country.\nThey should keep the Party's revolutionary ideas and theories as an article of their firm faith and be possessed of an ennobling view of the rising generations, sound mental and moral traits and pure conscience becoming teachers. They should be loyalists to the Party and the revolution, strong in ideology and faith, before being teachers and scientists. No matter how excellent their practical abilities may be, teachers and researchers devoid of strong faith cannot make a genuine contribution to the Party and the revolution. Fully aware that they are responsible for the future of the country, they should devote their all to teaching and scientific research.\nTheir qualifications are represented in their students' academic abilities and achievements in their scientific research. They should raise a hot wind of improving their qualifications and competing for better practical abilities so as to prepare themselves as model teachers and authoritative, world-class scholars whom no one can rival in their major fields.\nThey should become genuine educationists who teach the students through their personal examples and enjoy the love and respect of officials and working people as well as their students for their great practical abilities, ennobling traits and outstanding achievements.\nStudents at Kim Il Sung University are reserve hardcore talents who will become leading officials of the revolution responsible for the important sectors and posts in the building of a powerful socialist country, the backbone in the struggle for the victory of the Juche revolution.\nThey should become true revolutionaries who cherish the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as an article of their faith and talented revolutionaries of the Juche type, creative talents who are possessed of the intellectual abilities with which to beat the world and of lofty and highly-civilized cultural attainments.\nKeeping in mind the autographic propositions of the great General Kim Jong Il embossed on the front wall of the lobby in the university's e-library, all the students of the university should study hard with a high ambition to become the backbone of the revolution, competent personnel in the new century, who will add brilliance to Kim Il Sung's nation, Kim Jong Il's Korea, before the eyes of the world. Fully aware that they themselves hold the key to success in their university days, they should improve themselves spiritually and morally, and save every minute to broaden and enrich their knowledge and apply it to practice.\nWe are competing with the world, and it is the students of Kim Il Sung University that must stand at the centre of this competition. They should fully demonstrate the dignity and honour of Kim Il Sung University by blazing the trail for the development of cutting-edge science with the ambition of challenging the world, competing with the world and beating the world with their brains.\nThe university should make sure that all aspects of university life, like giving education, conducting activities in political organizations and establishing discipline, are geared to and subordinated to raising the wind among students of learning and improving their academic performance.\nThe Party and the state should direct efforts to developing Kim Il Sung University into one of the most prestigious universities in the world.\nTo develop the university as such is a task which our Party prioritizes these days.\nThe Science and Education Department and other relevant departments of the Party Central Committee and the Pyongyang Municipal Party Committee should exert themselves to carry on this work as intended by the great General and the Party, and the sectors and units concerned should take a deep interest in the university work and help it proactively.\nThe Cabinet and relevant organs should throw their full weight behind the work of developing Kim Il Sung University into a base for scientific and technological research, in which education, scientific research and production are integrated. They should supply the university with necessary modern apparatuses for experiment and internship, printing equipment and teaching aids and furnishings on a top priority basis, and properly help it build up its internship and supply service bases so that its educational conditions and environment can reach the world standards. Measures should be taken by the state to improve the educational and scientific research conditions at the university and the living conditions of its teaching staff and students.\nThe university should work out a strategy and targets for developing itself into one of the most prestigious universities in the world on the principle of self-reliance and self-development and on a scientific and realistic basis to meet our actual conditions and the world trend, and carry them out one by one. In doing so, it should reject sycophancy, dogmatism and imitation and, when adopting the good experience of others, it should not confine itself to adopting them, but strive to attain a higher level. It should not turn to someone else for help, but renovate its teaching and scientific research facilities, develop equipment and instruments for experiment and internship and build up its supply service base by relying on its own efforts and technology.\nThe university area is located near the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il are preserved in their lifetime appearance, and it is a large revolutionary site, all of which are associated with the leadership of the great leaders. The teaching staff and students of the university should devote their unstained loyalty and patriotism to developing their university into an unparalleled, excellent base for education and edification, into the highest institute of science and education and keeping it neat and tidy.\nThe Party committees of Kim Il Sung University and its colleges should improve their functions and role.\nThese Party committees should keep it as their lifeline to carry out the instructions of the great leaders and defend and exalt the brilliance of their leadership exploits. As everything at the university is associated with their leadership exploits, all the teaching staff and students should be encouraged to have a deep understanding of these exploits at every moment of their life in the campus and seek the worth of life in maintaining and exalting the brilliance of the exploits.\nThey should bolster up policy-oriented guidance, or political guidance, so that all affairs including educational administration aspire to implementing the great leaders' instructions and the Party's line and policies of education. In particular, they should direct a great effort to developing the university into a most prestigious one with confidence and on a long-term basis true to the intention of the Party.\nHolding fast to the theory of our Party on prioritizing ideology, they should launch among the teaching staff and students a dynamic and substantial campaign for the five-point education with the stress on the education in the greatness of the leaders. In this way, they can train all of them into people with indomitable ideological and spiritual qualities, ardent patriots, vanguard fighters for their class and persons with a noble sense of morality.\nThey should build up the ranks of teachers and researchers and organize and guide their Party life scrupulously to suit the features characteristic of intellectuals, so as to give full play to the spiritual strength of all the teachers, researchers and leading officials of the university.\nWork with students constitutes an important undertaking which the Party committees of the university should prioritize and to which they should pay special concern. They should intensify their guidance of students in their organizational and ideological activities so as to encourage them to study hard and help them acquire the revolutionary spirit and the sense of organization and discipline. They should properly lead the youth league organizations to carry on the work with students in a creative and proactive way with the main stress on applying the study-first principle in a thoroughgoing way. They should ensure that the principle of prioritizing merit is observed in recruiting students, so that those who are qualified and promising are enrolled in the university.\nAll officials should oppose abuses of power, bureaucratism and corruption and maintain it as revolutionary ethics inherent in them and revolutionary Party climate to make selfless, devoted efforts for the teaching staff and students. They should also intensify ideological education and ideological struggle to strictly prevent all manner of non-socialist practices and practices that tarnish the reputation of the socialist education system from being revealed among the teaching staff and students.\nIt is important to enhance the role of the university council and the university Party guidance committee.\nThey should deal with important issues arising in improving education and scientific research at the university and its colleges and developing the university into one of the most prestigious universities in the world. They should organize the work of developing the university into a most prestigious university under a long-term plan and with methodology so that its colleges, faculties and departments will make competitive efforts to surpass the major indexes of the most prestigious universities in the world.\nThe university council should be formed not only with officials of the university and its colleges but also with leading officials of the Party, the state and important units so as to enhance the authority of the council and heighten the national and social interest in the university work.\nOur Party and people expect a great deal from Kim Il Sung University.\nWhen the university dynamically advances to beat the world full of confidence and vitality, the day of final victory in the Juche revolution will come earlier.\nI firmly believe that, true to the intention of the Party Central Committee, all the teachers, researchers, officials and other staff members and students of Kim Il Sung University will fully discharge the noble mission and duty they have assumed for the times and the revolution by adding eternal brilliance to it as the university of the great leaders and proudly raising it to the front rank of the most prestigious universities in the world.\nPolitical News Team\n"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Inspects Mangyongdae Revolutionary Site Souvenir Factory","body":"Kim Jong Un Inspects Mangyongdae Revolutionary Site Souvenir Factory\n \nKim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, provided field guidance to the Mangyongdae Revolutionary Site Souvenir Factory.\nKim Jong Un learned in detail about the situation of the factory and gave an instruction to turn it into a factory producing not only souvenirs but also various consumer goods by remodeling it as required by the new century and installing modern zipper, melamine resin goods and other production processes in addition and took a step for doing so.\nHe looked round the room dedicated to the history of the factory.

In the trying days of the Arduous March and anti-US confrontation, they fought with a do-or-die determination and will, thus making a great contribution to the development of the self-reliant defence industry and to the cause of building a powerful socialist country. The world-startling, miraculous events including those of turning misfortunes into blessing taking place now in various parts of the country are associated with the sweat and blood of patriotic loyalty shed by the working class and other trade union members who are supporting the Party's leadership with one mind and will, shoulder to shoulder with the service personnel.\nI extend warm thanks and militant greetings to the working class, other trade union members and officials of the GFTUK across the country, who, believing only in our Party with a single mind both in good times and bad, have devoted their patriotic enthusiasm and wisdom for the prosperity of the socialist country to the call of the Party and the leaders.\nToday our people have forcefully turned out in the grandiose struggle to build a powerful socialist country under the banner of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism advanced by the historic Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea.\nIn today's all-people general onward march, the working class, strong in the spirit of the revolution and organization and possessed of inexhaustible creative strength, ought to take charge of and play a leading, pioneer role.\nOur Party conferred the honourable title, \"the heroic working class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il,\" on our working class that supported the great leaders' ideas and leadership with loyalty. This title bears the unshakeable will and determination of our Party to carry forward in their entirety the idea of prioritizing the working class and leadership of the great leaders, who, by placing them in the vanguard, effected gigantic social and historical changes and tided over the trying hardships; it also reflects the Party's great trust and expectation that they will fulfil their basic duty as the working class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in implementing the revolutionary cause of Juche.\nThe heroic working class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, holding aloft the banner of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, should become the engine propelling the masses forward on the general onward march and the example for all other members of society to follow in stepping up the building of a powerful socialist country. This is the noble duty they have assumed for the country and the revolution in the new era of the Juche revolution.\nBearing in mind the great trust of the Party and the people, our working class should creditably perform this honourable mission and duty as befits the advance force for the Juche revolution and the eldest sons of the nation who have been trained under the close concern of the great leaders.\nFor them to fulfil their sacred duty for the times, it is important to bring about a decisive improvement in the work of the GFTUK.\nThe GFTUK is a powerful political instrument for training its members, including the working class, into Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists with unfailing loyalty to the Party and the leader and mobilizing them to implement the revolutionary cause of Juche.\nIt should take modelling itself on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as its general task.\nOur revolution advances and wins victories on the strength of the unity of the Party, the army and the broad sections of the working masses. Modelling the whole Party, the entire army and working people's organizations including the youth league and the GFTUK on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is just the way to carry out the cause of imbuing the whole society with Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. And this is the key to the final victory of the socialist cause, the revolutionary cause of Juche.\nModelling the GFTUK on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is the fundamental guarantee for making the working class revolutionary, developing them into an elite force and enhancing their core, leading role in every way possible. When the working class, who constitute the progressive force and hardcore of our society, become the engine and play an exemplary role in leading its other members forward, the great cause will be successfully carried on of transforming all members of society and all realms of social life in keeping with the requirements of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\nThe Party's unified leadership system should be established more firmly across the GFTUK.\nModelling the GFTUK on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is an undertaking of developing it into a body that is ideologically pure and organizationally integrated, an organization over which Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism holds undivided sway and which moves as one under the Party's unified leadership.\nThe permanent guiding ideology of the GFTUK is the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. The GFTUK should conduct its building and activities with this ideology as its sole guideline. It should staunchly defend the great leaders' idea and theory on building trade union and their undying leadership exploits, and apply them to the letter. It should also carry out the instructions they gave in their lifetime, holding fast to them as its lifeblood.\nIt should remain infinitely loyal to the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea. Its organizations should adhere to our Party's ideas, lines and policies in planning and executing their work. They should establish rigid discipline and order whereby all the problems that arise in their work are brought to the Party in time and dealt with according to its decisions. They should defy death in implementing the Party's lines and policies. They should promptly transmit its policies and directives to the lowest echelons and carry them out in the shortest possible period and at the highest possible level. Just as the eldest child empathizes with and supports his or her parents before his or her siblings, so the working class, who are the eldest sons of the nation, should take the lead in translating the Party's intentions and demands into reality.\nDefending the Party Central Committee unto death is the life and soul and a proud tradition of the Korean working class. One generation of the working class may be replaced by another, but their tradition of faithfully supporting the Party and the leader and the history of single-hearted unity should be carried forward forever. The working class and other trade union members should absolutely trust and follow only the Party at all times and throw in their lot with it to the last like the workers of Kunja-ri and Ragwon who worked indomitably in the flames of war for its victory by cherishing the firm conviction that they would surely win as they were led by Comrade Kim Il Sung and like those of Kangson who guarded the Party and the leader at the risk of their lives by effecting the great Chollima upsurge. They should defend the ideology and authority of the Party in the spirit they displayed in postwar days, when they safeguarded the Party shouting they would throw the factional elements into the electric furnace; they should not in the least overlook or compromise with anti-Party and unsound practices of all hues revealed in implementing the Party's policies, but resolutely smash them with their iron fists.\nIt is necessary to strengthen guidance of the organizational and ideological life in the trade union so as to fully prepare all its members as true Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists.\nThe organizational and ideological life in the trade union is a school for ideological education to train its members to be Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists and a crucible for organizational training. Trade union organizations should take the guidance of organizational and ideological life as the main line and give top priority to it.\nAll efforts should be concentrated on the ideological education of trade union members.\nTrade union organizations should vigorously conduct the five-point education advanced by the Party in order to make all their members persons strong in ideas and faith, ardent patriots, vanguard fighters of the class and noble morality incarnate, who are fully equipped with the ideological and spiritual qualities becoming Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists. They should put efforts into educating their members to learn from the revolutionary soldier spirit and the spirit of the Paektusan hero youth. They should implant in them the Party's idea and line of prioritizing military affairs so as to make them study military affairs with sincerity and remain alert and prepared at all times by firmly holding the weapon of the revolution in one hand and the hammer of the class in the other. They should intensify ideological education and ideological struggle, which are aimed at smashing the reactionary ideological and cultural infiltration by the imperialists and their following forces, so as to keep their members from being contaminated by the capitalist poison and lead all of them to hold fast to the working-class stand and live and work in a sound and revolutionary manner.\nIdeological education of them should be conducted in various forms, by various methods and in a novel manner in keeping with their preparedness and characteristics. The precisely-targeted method of ideological work of the Party should be applied positively to step up the ideological remoulding of the working class and other trade union members and make the whole country bubble with enthusiasm for effecting a great upswing. It is important to properly furnish the educational bases of the trade union and conduct education by means of them in a planned and regular way. The education system set up in trade union organizations should be utilized in an effective way, and all the means and ways of information and motivation work enlisted in carrying out the tasks prioritized by the Party, important policy-oriented tasks.\nGuidance to the organizational life of the trade union members should be intensified.\nTrade union organizations should make scrupulous arrangements for guiding them in their organizational life with the focus put on improving their loyalty to the Party and the leader and in combination with the implementation of their revolutionary assignments. They should encourage them to get into the habit of voluntarily participating in the organizational life, so that they always rely on their organizations in and out of work and carry out the decisions and assignments of their organizations in time and without fail. They should improve the level of organizational life review sessions to make them an important occasion in educating and training their members in a revolutionary way.\nThey should establish rigid organizational discipline and make a strict demand for organizational life. They should arrange the organizational life in compliance with the union Rules and the regulations of union life and strengthen organizational control of their members to prevent them from living divorced from their organizations.\nThe working class and other trade union members should be enlisted in the building of a powerful socialist country.\nTrade union organizations should conduct dynamic political work, information and motivation work, aimed at giving free rein to the spiritual strength of the working class and other trade union members who are out in socialist construction, and thus encourage them to perform fresh miraculous feats. This will make it possible to help the working class and other trade union members conduct a vigorous production campaign to implement the five-year strategy for national economic development, fulfil their daily, monthly and quarterly assignments without fail and become honourable Mallima riders who perform miraculous innovations in science, education, public health, literature, the arts and all other fields. They should also work devotedly in their workplaces regarding them as outposts in the grand campaign to build a powerful socialist country, and thus create more assets conducive to strengthening the country's defence capability, developing the economy and promoting the people's well-being.\nIt is important in building a powerful socialist country to comprehensively apply the spirit of self-development first. Cherishing the firm conviction that things of our own are the best and our own strength is the greatest, the working class and other trade union members should give full play to their fighting spirit of self-reliance so as to boldly effect domestic production of necessary materials and equipment and upgrading of technical processes of production and create the highest standard of socialist civilization. With the self-respect and courage as befits the working class of Korea, they should produce everything better than others', and thus sweep away the proclivity to imports and demonstrate the resourcefulness of the nation and the honour of the country.\nIf they are to be strong in the self-development capability and play the major role in the era of the knowledge-based economy, the working class and other trade union members should master modern science and technology. Nothing is impossible when the revolutionary spirit of the working class is combined with modern science and technology. The working class and other trade union members, bearing in mind the Party's intention to prepare all the people as intelligent workers, scientific and technical personnel, should be enrolled in the study-while-you-work system like distance education and study hard to raise the level of their knowledge of modern science and technology and cultural attainments. They should reject the tendencies to relying only on experience and thinking technology as something mysterious, and present new inventions and valuable technical innovations, thus making a positive contribution to the scientific and technological development of their respective units and to the building of a knowledge-based economy. Trade union organizations should support and lead the working class and other trade union members so that they can stand in the vanguard of the campaign to make all the people well-versed in science and technology.\nTrade union organizations should ensure that the working class and other trade union members conduct mass-based sporting, cultural and artistic activities on a regular basis and establish a cultured way of production and life, so as to create a new culture of the working class and make the whole society brim over with vibrant spirit.\nMass movement is a powerful means for bringing about an uninterrupted upsurge in socialist construction on the strength of collective innovations. Trade union organizations should organize and briskly conduct socialist emulation campaign, mass technical innovation drive, movement to create model lathes following the example of Lathe No. 26, good-conduct movement and other mass movements as demanded by the reality, when a powerful socialist country is being built on a new high. By doing so, they can encourage the working class and other trade union members to devote all their enthusiasm and wisdom to socialist construction. They should set ambitious targets for the movements, with the main stress put on implementing the strategic tasks advanced by the Seventh Congress of the Party and in reflection of the aspirations and demands of the masses, and strive persistently to hit them; then the vitality of these movements can be given fullest play. They should give the working class and other trade union members a correct understanding of the objectives of the movements and ways of achieving them, generalize positive examples and properly review and evaluate the results, so as to inspire them with interest in and enthusiasm for the movements and enliven the social atmosphere.\nIt is an important task facing the working class and the GFTUK to strive for the realization of the independent reunification of the country and global independence.\nThe working class and other trade union members should fully equip themselves with our Party's line and policy of the independent national reunification, and stand in the vanguard of the struggle to carry them out. They should actively support and encourage the workers in south Korea in their struggle for anti-US independence, democratization of society and their right to existence, promote solidarity and collaboration with labour union organizations in south Korea under the ideal of By Our Nation Itself, and thus open up the road to independent reunification.\nThe GFTUK should defend and apply our Party's idea and principles of foreign policy, encourage the progressive peoples of the world in their struggle for independence, peace and socialism, and develop relations of good-neighbourliness, friendship and cooperation with the trade unions in other countries and international labour organizations, so as to expand the ranks of the supporters of and sympathizers with our revolution and accelerate the cause of global independence.\nFor the successful implementation of the tasks facing the GFTUK, its organizations at all levels should be strengthened and their functions and role enhanced.\nGuidance organs of the GFTUK should be built up, and their members should fully discharge their responsibilities. These organs at all levels should be formed with many hard-core trade union members working on the shop floor, as well as officials of the GFTUK and in the administrative and economic sectors. The organs should take proactive steps to carry out the tasks facing trade union organizations and give assignments to their members on a regular basis, thus making them active in their work.\nThe main link in the whole chain of improving the trade union work is to enhance the role of its primary organizations including those at the lowest echelons, the basic combat units in implementing the Party's policies for the GFTUK. They should give priority to the work with their members so as to rally all of them firmly behind the Party and inspire them forcefully to the implementation of its policies. By working effectively with their hard-core, active members, they should remould the masses in such a way that one educates ten and ten, one hundred, and thus strengthen themselves. As for the members who have some shortcomings in their work and life, they should make earnest efforts to educate them and help them with sincerity, so that all their members can keep pace with the dynamic advance of the times, their hearts pulsating to the same beat as it. It is necessary to step up the movement for creating the Model Organization of Loyalty and organize on an extensive scale the campaigns in which one overtakes and learns from others and swaps experiences with them, so that all the primary organizations work with unabated vigour and the whole of the GFTUK brims over with enthusiasm.\nProvincial, city and county committees of the GFTUK should enhance their role. Provincial committees of the GFTUK, as its regional guidance units, should establish a well-regulated organizational life guidance system and strengthen control and guidance over their subordinate organizations, so as to make them working political entities. City and county trade union organizations should put the main emphasis on their internal work and work with the lower-echelon organizations, with the aim of steadily enhancing their fighting efficiency.\nThe Central Committee of the GFTUK is the General Staff that is responsible for planning the trade union work as a whole and providing unified guidance over it under the leadership of the Party. It should take the great leaders' instructions and the Party's policies as its sole guideline and orient all aspects of its work to implementing them. It should ensure that its departments and sections cooperate with one another under a scrupulous plan, and exercise effective control and guidance over its subordinates.\nThe fighting efficiency and role of trade union organizations are dependent largely on the qualifications and work methods of their officials who are in charge of organizing and guiding the trade union work.\nTrade union officials should make efforts to improve their political and practical qualifications. They should firmly equip themselves with Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and be fully conversant with the great leaders' instructions and the Party's policies for their respective sectors, making them an element of their firm faith. They should become competent political workers who are proficient in the trade union work and capable of organizing and conducting it creatively on their own initiative. They should acquire many-sided knowledge including modern science and technology and enhance their cultural attainments, mixing unceremoniously with the masses and effectively enlisting them in creating a Mallima speed.\nTrade union officials should fully equip themselves with Comrade Kim Jong Il's work methods and apply them to practice. They should follow the ennobling examples he set in educating and guiding the masses, and do everything as instructed by him. They should go down to the lower echelons as a matter of routine, mingling with the masses in and out of their work and helping and leading them forward. They should eliminate such outdated and backward methods of working as merely conveying the Party's policies to the lower-echelon organizations or confining the trade union work to meetings and paperwork. Instead, they should always go deep among the masses, sowing seeds and harvesting fruits by themselves.\nParty organizations should prioritize the trade union work and throw their full weight behind it.\nThey should build up the ranks of trade union officials with competent people who are faithful to the Party, popular among the masses, tempered through labour and possessed of practical abilities. They should pay close concern to educating these officials to ensure that they are fully aware of their basic duty and make strenuous efforts to fulfil their responsibility and role. They should identify, among trade union members on the shop floor, those who are loyal to the Party and promising, as reserve cadres of the GFTUK, temper them through practice and send them to training institutions so as to bring them up in a systematic way.\nTrade union organizations should be encouraged to enhance their sense of independence and creativity. Party committees at all levels should promptly inform them of the Party's policies in each period so that they can conduct their work and activities in conformity with the ideas and intentions of the Party. Party organizations should lead them to draw up their work plans in a proactive way and carry them out with courage. They should do away with the practice of shouldering the work of trade union organizations in their place; they should be bold in assigning tasks to trade union officials and inspire them to carry them out by their own efforts. They should provide trade union organizations with working conditions and give prominence and praise to their officials for the work done, so that they can work to the best of their abilities feeling dignity and honour.\nWhen the working class redouble their efforts and trade union organizations are full of vigour, the might of our revolutionary ranks will be further strengthened and bigger strides will be made in the building of a powerful socialist country.\nI firmly believe that the working class and all other members of the GFTUK and its organizations will fully demonstrate the heroic mettle as befits the working class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and will make an active contribution to hastening final victory in building a powerful socialist country by fulfilling with credit the noble mission and duty they have assumed for the country and the revolution, true to the lofty intentions of the great leaders.\n"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Provides Field Guidance to Ryongaksan Soap Factory","body":"Kim Jong Un Provides Field Guidance to Ryongaksan Soap Factory\n \nKim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, provided field guidance to the newly built Ryongaksan Soap Factory.\nEnjoying a panoramic view of the factory with a broad smile on his face, he said with great satisfaction that a large-scale modern factory was built in a matter of a few months though it seemed like yesterday when he was visiting the construction site.

After the liberation of the country, he founded the women’s union before other working people’s organizations, indicated the road ahead of it in every period and at every stage of the revolution and construction, and wisely led it so that it could creditably perform its role as a transmission belt of and reliable assistant to the Party. He proclaimed the Law on Sex Equality, thus bringing about epoch-making changes in the status of women and training them to be a powerful force capable of turning one of the two wheels of the revolution.\nComrade Kim Jong Il energetically led the work of defending and honouring Comrade Kim Il Sung’s ideas of and exploits in the Juche-oriented women’s movement. He developed the women’s union into a revolutionary and militant organization faithfully supporting the Party’s leadership and, by administering politics of prioritizing and respecting women, led them to make an active contribution to the sacred struggle for achieving the victory of the socialist cause while leading a dignified and happy life.\nUnder the wise guidance of the great leaders the women’s union and women created a history resplendent with victory and glory, carrying forward the traditions of the Juche-oriented women’s movement.\nIn the grim decades of the revolution, the Korean women held up Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il as their leaders and fathers and resolutely defended them, and death-defyingly carried out the lines and policies advanced by them in any adversity. Loyalty to the Party and the leaders was an element of unshakable revolutionary faith, conscience, will and practice of the Korean women.\nIn the days of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle our women waged a bloody struggle with weapons in their hands to liberate their country. In the days of the fierce Fatherland Liberation War they fought do-or-die battles on the front and in the rear to defend their country against the imperialist aggression, displaying unparalleled bravery and self-sacrificing spirit. Cherishing ardent patriotism, they have performed brilliant feats in building and successfully advancing socialism and building a powerful socialist country. Our women, simple-hearted and strong in the sense of honour, have given full play to their ennobling traits and spirit of devoted struggle, dedicating their all for the sake of society and their communities and revolutionary comrades, and exalted the brilliance of our grand socialist family.\nOrganizations of the women’s union and its members, in hearty response to the Party’s call, are playing a great role in the 200-day campaign aimed at glorifying this year, when the Seventh Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea was held, as a victorious year. The women’s union members have turned out in the rehabilitation sites in the flood-hit northern area where a miracle of turning the misfortune into blessing is being wrought to the wonder of the world, bringing the militant atmosphere there to a crescendo by conducting the women’s union shock brigade activities, artistic motivation activities and various other laudable deeds.\nOur women’s union members and other women are really excellent and praiseworthy. Unstained loyalty to the Party and the leaders, spirit of devoted service for the country and fellow people and ennobling sense of moral obligation–these are the ideological and spiritual features of our women, and it is a source of great pride for our Party and people to have a large contingent of such excellent women revolutionaries.\nOur Party highly appreciates and will never forget the achievements of the women’s union members and other women who, faithfully supporting the leadership of the Party and the leaders, have added lustre to the glorious tradition of the Korean women’s movement over a long period from the dawn of the Korean revolution.\nI extend warm thanks to the women’s union members and all other women who have worked with devotion for the victorious advance of the Korean revolution and the development of the women’s movement, holding the great leaders in high esteem and supporting the Party’s leadership with loyalty.\nThe present is a new era of the Juche revolution in which we are advancing by leaps and bounds towards final victory, holding aloft the banner of the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. The historic Seventh Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea set out strategic lines and tasks to accomplish the cause of building a powerful socialist country in accordance with the programme of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\nThe women’s union should strive hard for the modelling of the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism under the Party’s leadership, thereby rendering a positive contribution to accomplishing the socialist cause, the revolutionary cause of Juche. This is a noble mission it has assumed for the times and the revolution. It should carry forward the glorious tradition of the Juche-oriented women’s movement to perform its honourable mission and duty with credit.\nThe general task facing the women’s union is to model itself on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\nModelling the women’s union on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism–this is the comprehensive implementation of our Party’s idea of prioritizing women and the fundamental requirement for modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. The women’s union should model itself on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism to develop into a revolutionary organization that is unfailingly faithful to the Party’s ideology and cause.\nIt should add brilliance to the great leaders’ ideology and exploits and support the Party’s leadership with loyalty.\nThe kernel of the tradition of the Juche-oriented women’s movement is unfailing loyalty to the Party and the leaders. The women’s union should regard this as its lifeblood and develop into the eternal organization of the great leaders and our Party.\nThe great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il are the eternal leaders of our Party and people and benevolent fathers of our women. Women’s union members and other women should hold them up as the Sun of Juche for all ages and add eternal brilliance to their cause.\nThe great leaders’ idea on the women’s movement and their leadership exploits are the lasting foundation for the development of the women’s union. Women’s union officials and all other members should be fully conversant with the leaders’ idea and exploits and make them an article of their firm faith. With this idea as its guideline the women’s union should conduct its building and activities and carry through the leaders’ instructions.\nThe women’s union should constantly intensify the work of establishing the Party’s unified leadership system.\nThis is the basic principle to be maintained in its building and activities and a permanent task facing its organizations. All the women’s union members should fully equip themselves with our Party’s revolutionary ideology, achieve solid unity in ideology, purpose and moral obligation behind the Party Central Committee, and staunchly defend the Party’s lines and policies and carry them out even at the risk of their lives. Women’s union organizations should establish revolutionary discipline and order whereby they move as one under the unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, report to it all the matters arising in the union work and deal with them according to its unified conclusion.\nThe women’s union should train its members into steadfast Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists.\nA Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist is a revolutionary of the Juche type who has made the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism an article of his or her firm faith, remains unfailingly loyal to the Party and the leader, and works with devotion for victory in the revolutionary cause of Juche. Only when women, who make up half of the country’s population and have a significant role to play in bringing up the rising generations and building a powerful socialist country, are fully prepared as Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists, can the modelling of the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism be realized successfully.\nWomen’s union organizations should conduct effective ideological education among their members and intensify guidance over their organizational life, with the main stress put on training them into Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists.\nThe women’s union is a body for political and ideological education and its organizations’ basic duty is to conduct ideological education. These organizations should hold fast to ideology, always paying primary concern to ideological education.\nWomen’s union organizations should step up education in Kim Jong Il’s patriotism, revolutionary faith, anti-imperialist and class consciousness and socialist morality, with the focus on education in the greatness of the leaders, so that all their members can cherish boundless loyalty to the Party and the leaders, ardent love for their country, the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, unwavering conviction in socialism, steadfast anti-imperialist and class consciousness and the ennobling sense of moral obligation.\nThey should conduct intensive education among their members and other women and wage a dynamic struggle to frustrate the imperialists’ schemes for ideological and cultural infiltration and eliminate non-socialist practices. The capitalist, bourgeois ideology and culture and alien lifestyle the imperialists are spreading are a dangerous poison that undermines the socialist system from within by debasing and degenerating the people ideologically and morally. Women’s union organizations should prevent this poison from infiltrating us and intensify education and struggle geared to removing, at the first signs, the root cause of unnatural lifestyle and non-socialist practices of all hues from among women’s union members and other women.\nWomen’s union organizations should radically improve the forms and methods of ideological education. By comprehensively applying the anti-Japanese guerrillas’ method of ideological work, they should adopt various forms and methods in conducting ideological education, with the main emphasis on explanation, persuasion and influencing with positive examples, in line with the requirements of the stirring era and characteristics of women. To meet the demands of the precisely targeted method of ideological work, set out by the Party, they should identify the major targets and enlist all means of information and motivation work in launching a focused ideological offensive.\nThe women’s union should build up the bases for the education of its members, conduct regular and effective education by means of them and efficiently operate the system of information and motivation work that has been set in place within its organizations. it should ensure that its senior expositors, expositors at primary organizations and expositors’ groups of the women’s union perform their role with credit. It should also see to it that the journal Joson Nyosong and other publications are responsive to Party policy and edit articles in keeping with the requirements of its members and other women and their aesthetic appreciation, thus making a contribution to educating them.\nWomen’s union organizations should intensify the organizational life of their members.\nThey can be called the blood vessels that link their members’ socio-political integrity with the Party. They should make sure that their members treasure their organizations and participate in the organizational life voluntarily and faithfully, cherishing the dignity of and pride in being members of the women’s union guided by the Workers’ Party of Korea. They should ensure that their members always work and live by relying on their organizations and carry out their decisions and individual assignments given by them in a responsible manner. They should make an exacting demand on their members so that they will work and live in compliance with the Rules of the union and the regulations of the union life.\nThe women’s union should encourage its members to make a tangible contribution to building a powerful socialist country.\nTo build a powerful socialist country is a sacred, patriotic cause for achieving its prosperity and the well-being of all the generations to come, and it should be a struggle involving all the patriotic-minded people who are determined to throw themselves into this cause. Women’s union members and other women, by carrying forward the heroic fighting spirit displayed by their preceding generations, should devote their strength, wisdom and enthusiasm to building a powerful socialist country.\nThe women’s union shock brigade movement that is now in full swing in several sectors of socialist construction is a women’s mass movement of loyalty geared to rendering services to building a powerful socialist country and improving the people’s standard of living; this is a laudable, patriotic movement. Women’s union organizations should continue to briskly conduct the shock brigade movement as a reflection of the voluntary and revolutionary zeal of their members and their concrete situations. They should organize various other good-conduct movements among their members, including silk-raising movement, raise the strong wind of socialist emulation drive to create a model unit and launch vigorous campaigns in which one overtakes and learns from others and swaps experiences with them.\nWomen’s union members and other women should turn out in the economy drive with ardent patriotism and an attitude befitting masters in managing the country’s economy. They should make economical use of every watt of electricity, every drop of water and every grain of rice for the country and for building it into an economic giant, and wage a struggle against all practices of extravagance, useless formalities and waste that run counter to the requirements and climate of the era.\nWomen’s union organizations should make scrupulous arrangements to encourage housewives to launch into society.\nThis is necessary to solve the problem of labour shortage, but it is of greater importance in helping all women to enjoy an honourable life in the worthwhile struggle for the sake of their country and fellow people in the present era of Mallima that advances by leaps and bounds. Women’s union organizations should work with housewives in an effective way so that women of working age can do their share by actively volunteering to work at the sites where a powerful socialist country is being built.\nBy actively conducting motivation work including artistic activities, women’s union organizations should make the whole country seethe with revolutionary enthusiasm, and by drumming up support for increased production, they should give a powerful impetus to the struggle to achieve the high objectives of the five-year strategy for national economic development at the earliest date possible.\nNational defence is a duty of citizens, and nothing is more honourable than to defend the country. A genuine life, harmonious families and happy living for women and the coming generations cannot be guaranteed if they have no country of their own. Many women in several countries are now suffering from misfortune and pain owing to the imperialists’ acts of aggression and intervention; this miserable reality testifies that arms are the guarantee for the security of a country and a people and for the dignity of women. Our women and other people have lived in a peaceful environment for decades without experiencing the holocaust of war. This is attributable entirely to Songun politics.\nWomen’s union organizations should ensure that their members are fully equipped with the Party’s idea and line of attaching importance to military affairs, remain alert and ready for action at all times, and become today’s “Namgang village women” in the all-out resistance for defending the socialist country against the imperialists’ aggression.\nWomen’s union members should love service personnel as they would do their own kith and kin and render wholehearted aid to the People’s Army. Wives of the service personnel should become reliable revolutionary comrades-in-arms of their husbands and look after the rank-and-file soldiers with the hearts of their sisters and mothers as befit the revolutionaries in the Songun era and the cooks for the Supreme Headquarters. Women’s union members and other women should regard it as a revolutionary tradition of their families and a source of their pride to place their sons and daughters at the posts of national defence by preparing them fully ideologically, mentally and physically; they should pay deep concern to the life of war veterans, honoured disabled soldiers, families of fallen soldiers and families of service personnel and take warm care of them.\nWomen’s union members and other women should fully discharge their heavy responsibilities and role in educating the rising generations to be dependable pillars of Juche Korea.\nNo one can replace mothers in educating the rising generations who will take charge of the future of the country. The dear and kind word mother carries social respect and high expectations for women who regard every manner of toil for the next generation as pleasure and devote love and affection to them. Neither family nor society nor the future of a country can exist without women.\nWomen’s union members and other women should be roots and foundations for applying the Party’s love for the rising generations, the future of the nation.\nWomen’s union organizations should improve the living environment at nurseries and kindergartens and the conditions for nursing and educating their pupils to meet the demands of the new century, and be effective in their upbringing and education. The nurses and teachers at baby homes and orphanages should take care of the orphans as their own mothers would do and help them cultivate ennobling moral traits, creativity, independence and collectivist spirit, so as to bring them up as pillars who will shoulder the future of the country.\nWomen’s union members and other women should educate their sons and daughters well. Fully aware of the mission and responsibility due to a mother, they should educate their children with all sincerity and with great efforts. Mothers should ensure that every moment of their speaking and life serves as a course of educating their sons and daughters, so as to bring them up as successors to the revolution and masters of the future and make theirs revolutionary families of soldiers, scientists and patriots. In order to bring up their children well, mothers themselves should possess ennobling human and revolutionary qualities, profound knowledge and high cultural attainments. It is an important matter that has a bearing on the future of the country and nation that women give birth to many children and bring them up well. Women should be encouraged to give birth to many children.\nWomen’s union members and other women should play the role of pioneer in establishing socialist way of life and moral discipline throughout society.\nThe foundation of social life in socialism is collectivism, and the foundation of collectivism is love for human beings. Women’s union members and other women should observe the collectivist way of life in which everyone loves her comrades, blood relatives and fellow people and work with devotion for society and their communities, helping and leading one another forward.\nWomen’s union members and other women should lead an optimistic and cultured way of life. When women are full of laughter and optimism, our society will become brighter. They should take an active part in the mass-based cultural, artistic and sporting activities to establish a lively atmosphere across society, and make their attire and personal appearance beautiful and smart as required by modern aesthetic feelings and our national sentiments. As those in charge of home affairs, women should arrange in a civilized way the family life like keeping their houses clean inside and out and establishing culture in the dietary life.\nWomen’s union members and other women should turn their villages and streets into socialist fairyland. Women’s union organizations should push ahead with this work in combination with the movement of winning the title of July 11 Red Flag Dong and People’s Neighbourhood Unit.\nIt is important to establish moral discipline among women’s union members and other women. It they fail to do so, their families and their rising generations as well as themselves may be degenerated ideologically and morally. They should respect their revolutionary forerunners, teachers and seniors and fulfil the moral obligation and responsibility they have assumed for their families and society as wives and daughters-in-law. They should always act politely and observe public morality and social order on a voluntary basis and in an exemplary manner.\nThe women’s union should struggle for the independent reunification of the country and global independence.\nTo achieve the country’s reunification is the supreme national task which we must carry out in our generation. The women’s union and women should push ahead one of the two wheels of the national reunification movement upholding the three charters for national reunification. They should render active support and encouragement to the south Korean women in their struggle for anti-US independence, social democracy and national reunification, as well as to the overseas Korean women in their patriotic struggle for democratic national rights and the independent reunification of their motherland.\nHolding aloft the banner of independence, peace and friendship, the women’s union should strengthen international unity and solidarity with the world’s progressive women and their organizations aspiring after independence, and give encouragement to other women across the world in their just struggle for their dignity and rights and global peace and security.\nFor the strengthening of the women’s union work, it is important to build up its organizations and improve their militant functions and role.\nThe guidance organs of the women’s union organizations at all levels should be staffed with able officials and hardcore and active members of the women’s union who are loyal to the Party and steeled and tested in the practical struggle, their function of collective guidance improved, and the sense of responsibility and role of their members enhanced.\nThe primary organizations of the women’s union should increase their fighting efficiency. As its lowest-echelon organizations, they are bases for their members’ organizational life. The women’s union should form its primary organizations according to the principle of its Rules and in conformity with the specific conditions of relevant units, and direct close concern to the guidance for their improved role, thus making all of them militant bodies strong in organization and discipline.\nThe women’s union should step up the movement of winning the titles of Model Primary Organization and Model Primary Committee to increase the number of the holders of these titles, and should be effective in its re-assessment of them to make this serve as an important occasion for strengthening its organizations.\nThe Central Committee of the DWUK is the General Staff that plans and directs the union work in a unified way under the banner of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. It should plan and guide all its work in conformity with the intentions of the Party’s policies. Officials of the Central Committee of the DWUK should always cherish the trust and expectations of the Party and carry out their tasks in a responsible manner.\nA well-regulated system of work and strict discipline should be established in the women’s union.\nThe women’s union should establish in a well-regulated way the work system by which its organizations at all levels carry out its decisions for implementing the Party’s policies and report the results in time and the guidance system by which its organizations go down to the organizations at lower echelons on a regular basis, keep up-to-date with their work, take appropriate measures and help them in an effective way. And it should establish discipline by which all its work is conducted as required by the Rules of the union and work guidelines.\nA change should be brought about in the work style and attitude of the officials of the women’s union.\nWomen’s union officials are assistants to our Party, political workers and standard-bearers in the ranks of the women’s union. All the officials of the women’s union should cultivate the trait of death-defyingly implementing the Party’s policies, the spirit of self-reliance and self-development and a creative and enterprising work style, and give free rein to the assiduous, meticulous, untiring and diligent way of work as demanded by the present times that advance towards the final victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche.\nParty guidance over the work of the women’s union should be intensified.\nOur Party attaches great importance to the women’s union and pays close attention to its work. The fundamentals of Party guidance over its work are to ensure that its organizations conduct all their work and activities in line with the ideas and intentions of the Party. Party organizations should turn Party guidance over women’s union work into their own task, convey the Party’s policies and directives to women’s union organizations promptly and correctly and control and direct their implementation. In this way they can get women’s union organizations and officials to have a correct understanding of the Party’s policies and intentions and to make proactive efforts to carry them out.\nIt is important to enhance the independence of women’s union organizations and officials. Party organizations should actively put them forward, assign tasks to them and make a proper assessment of their performance so that they can carry on their work vigorously on their own initiative, full of pride, self-confidence and passion.\nParty organizations should show deep concern for building up the ranks of women’s union officials and improving their qualifications. Party organizations at all levels should get familiar with problems arising in building up their ranks and take timely measures, and carry on the work of improving their political and practical qualifications and training future women’s union officials in a planned way.\nParty organizations should provide women’s union organizations and officials with proper conditions for work and living. They should make sure that there is no practice of imposing burdensome tasks on women’s union organizations willy-nilly in discordance with the characteristics and conditions of the women’s union.\nIt is needed to make the whole Party and society give full play to the trait of respecting and loving women and actively helping the women’s union in its work.\nAt present the Party and people put great trust in and have high expectations of the women’s union. When the women’s union grows in strength and when its members and other women turn out vigorously, our revolutionary cause will advance with greater vitality.\nI firmly believe that all the organizations, officials and members of the women’s union will fulfil their honourable responsibility and duty in the struggle for the victorious advance of the Korean women’s movement and for the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of Juche, holding aloft the banner of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\nI wish our women including women’s union members, who are blooming as beautiful flowers of the country, life and families in the socialist flower garden of Juche, glory and happiness.\n"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Visits August 25 Fishery Station of KPA","body":"Kim Jong Un Visits August 25 Fishery Station of KPA\n \nKim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), gave field guidance to the August 25 Fishery Station of the KPA which created a history of unprecedented fish haul.\nSaying that the August 25 Fishery Station is the place he liked very much to visit as it wrote the first page of the history of unprecedented fish haul, he added that he came to the station again as he was eager to see its officials and employees.\nGoing round various places of the station, he learned in detail about fishing, storing and supply of fish.\nRepeatedly touching bales of frozen fish piled up high, he said with a broad smile on his face that such spectacular scenery can be seen at any fishery station of the KPA and he is very pleased to see the cold storage of the fishery station full of fish.\nHe dropped in at the salted fish storage and sat on the flange of the salting tank, pleased to see it filled with fish.\nHearing a report from officials that unprecedentedly big fish hauls were made during the period of intensive campaign for catching sailfin sandfish, he noted that the sea seemed to welcome fishermen of the station and shoals of fish came to meet them, touched by the loyalty with which they have displayed the spirit of devotedly implementing the Party policy, saying they would never return to the port before making big fish hauls and pledging to enter the yard of the Party Central Committee with a report on big fish hauls.\nNoting he feels refreshed, taking fish smell hanging in the compound of the fishery station, he said with satisfaction that he felt fresh strength welling up and proud of his work despite fatigue when hearing the story that officials in the fishery field of the KPA are racking their brain to dispose of the netted fish in good time.\nToday's eye-opening big fish hauls could be made by the officials and fishermen in the fishery field of the KPA as they have devoted themselves to implementing the Party policy with a firm determination, he added.\nHe indicated tasks facing the fishery field.\nHe had a photo session with the officials and employees of the fishery station.\nAccompanying him were Vice Marshal of the KPA Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, and Army Col.

He ensured that changes were brought about in resolving the problems of peasants and agriculture by implementing the historic agrarian reform and agricultural cooperativization and carrying on the socialist rural theses; and in step with the intensification of the revolution and construction, he saw to it that the peasants union was developed into the Union of Agricultural Workers of Korea.\nThe great Comrade Kim Jong Il provided energetic guidance to defend and honour Comrade Kim Il Sung’s idea of and exploits in socialist rural construction and make UAWK organizations creditably perform their duties as organizations for ideological education. He ensured that the union held fast to carrying out the socialist rural theses as its central task and further improved the role of its organizations in the gigantic practical struggle for increasing agricultural production, realigning crop fields and building gravitational waterways.\nThe UAWK and agricultural workers, in support of the leadership of the Party and the leaders in every decade of the revolution, strived to consolidate the class position in the countryside and fulfil their responsibility and basic duty as masters of the agricultural front.\nPeasants, who after the liberation of the country became the masters of their lands and their country under the benevolence of Comrade Kim Il Sung, launched the campaigns for increasing agricultural production and donating cereals out of patriotism, and thus faithfully supported the Party’s line of nation building. In the grim days of the Fatherland Liberation War they fought self-sacrificingly even during indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft, so as to send the front larger amounts of food grains. In the difficult postwar days, following Comrade Kim Il Sung with firm trust in him, they carried out the Party’s policy on agricultural cooperativization, and thus transformed the rural economy on the socialist lines in a short period and developed it remarkably; in this way, they confirmed through practice the advantages of the collective economy.\nIn the days of the Arduous March and forced march, the agricultural workers made tireless efforts to defend the socialist rural economic system and increase agricultural production without hesitating or vacillating in the face of the worst adversity and trials. UAWK organizations and agricultural workers raised a strong wind of collective competition in this year’s 70-day campaign and 200-day campaign, and thus brought about a surge in production and achieved excellent results in crop and fruit production.\nI extend warm thanks to the members of the UAWK and all other agricultural workers, who have worked with devotion, dedicating their unstained blood and sweats to the fields of the country out of loyalty and patriotism, to carry out the great leaders’ idea on socialist rural construction and the Party’s policy on agriculture.\nToday the UAWK and agricultural workers are faced with the heavy and yet honourable task for making a contribution to hastening the final victory of the Juche-oriented socialist cause by carrying out the socialist rural theses true to the programme of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism advanced at the Seventh Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea.\nAgricultural workers, together with the working class, constitute the main force in building a powerful socialist country, and the agricultural front is now a major thrust area in building the country into a socialist economic giant. Only when agricultural workers are trained to be genuine masters of the socialist countryside through an improved role of the UAWK and the agricultural front achieves a great victory as intended by the Party, can our revolutionary position be consolidated rock-solid and the cause of building a powerful socialist country accomplished with success.\nIf the UAWK is to fulfil the noble mission and duties it has assumed for the times and the revolution, it should model itself on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\nModelling itself on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism–this is the general objective and general fighting task of the UAWK. It should develop itself into an eternal organization of the great leaders and of the Party by preparing all its members as true Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists and conducting its building and activities as Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il did.\nThe UAWK should add further brilliance to the leadership exploits of the great leaders and faithfully support the Party’s leadership.\nIt should hold up the great leaders as the Sun of Juche for all ages and honour their idea of and imperishable exploits in socialist rural construction down through the generations. It should regard their instructions as its guidelines and apply them in its building and activities in a thoroughgoing way.\nEstablishing a thoroughgoing system of the Party’s unified leadership is the decisive guarantee for modelling the whole UAWK on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. Only when such system is established in the UAWK can its organizations be developed into powerful and militant ones that share ideology with the Party Central Committee, breathe the same breath as it and keep pace with it and fully perform their revolutionary tasks.\nThey should establish revolutionary discipline and order by which they conduct all their work in line with the requirements of the Party’s ideas and policies, report problems to the Party in time and deal with them according to its conclusion. They should create a revolutionary atmosphere of accepting the Party’s ideas and lines as an absolute truth and death-defyingly implementing its policies in any difficult conditions and circumstances.\nThe UAWK should mobilize its organizations and agricultural workers to the effort for carrying out socialist rural theses.\nThe theses published by Comrade Kim Il Sung clearly explains the fundamental principles, tasks and ways for solving the socialist rural question, including the problem of carrying out the three revolutions–ideological, technological and cultural–in the countryside. It is our Party’s programme for socialist rural construction to finally solve the rural question and the militant banner the UAWK should hold up consistently.\nThe UAWK should direct primary efforts to carrying out the ideological revolution in the countryside.\nThe ideological revolution in the countryside in the new era of the Juche revolution is a higher stage of ideological education, the work of transforming man, aimed at training all the agricultural workers into genuine Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists and Party’s faithful agricultural workers in line with the requirements of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\nUAWK organizations should take the ideological education to train their members to be Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists as their main duty, and orient to it the contents and methods of ideological education.\nThey should intensify the five-point education, with the focus put on education in the greatness of the leaders, so as to train all their members into genuine rural revolutionaries and patriotic farmers possessed of boundless loyalty to the Party and the leaders, Kim Jong Il’s patriotism, firm revolutionary faith, high class consciousness and ennobling moral traits.\nThey should conduct effective education to arm their members with the Party’s agricultural policy. They should make sure that their members have a correct understanding of the Party’s agricultural policies and its other policies set out in every period, as well as the Juche farming method. They should encourage their members to equip themselves with the revolutionary soldier spirit, the spirit of the Paektusan hero youth and the spirit of self-reliance and self-development and apply them in their practical work, thus creating new heroic miracles in the Mallima era.\nThey should strengthen the education in collectivism to make their members value the interests of society and the community more than their individual interests, take a sincere part in the collective life and communal labour and find the worth of genuine life in their society and community. They should encourage their members to learn from the ennobling self-sacrificing spirit of the farmer heroes in the Songun era who dedicated their lives without hesitation for the sake of their comrades and collectives, so that revolutionary comradeship and spirit of collective life of helping and caring for one another can pervade in their organizations.\nThey should steadily intensify ideological education and struggle among the agricultural workers to thwart the imperialists’ moves for ideological and cultural infiltration so as to allow no room for the capitalist ideology and culture and alien lifestyle to infiltrate and to ensure that various kinds of outdated ideological remnants and non-socialist practices are not revealed among them.\nThey should conduct ideological education as suited to the preparedness of the agricultural workers and the specific situations in the rural areas. As agricultural work becomes different according to season, political and ideological education should be undertaken in different ways, in a brief and flexible way on the fields in the busy season and in an intensive and profound way in the slack season. They should conduct education in a planned and regular manner by means of the bases for ideological education.\nThe educational system established within the UAWK should be run efficiently, and the sense of responsibility and role of the lecturers for study sessions, public lecturers and expositors enhanced. The newspaper Nongop Kulloja and other publications should be responsive to Party policy and demands of the realities, and edited in keeping with the characteristics of the agricultural workers, so that they can become intimate companions of UAWK members and other agricultural workers. It is also necessary to prepare substantive materials for political work for every period, send them down to lower echelons in time and use them effectively.\nUAWK organizations should push forward the technological and cultural revolutions in the countryside in line with the demands for building a sci-tech power and civilized nation.\nGiving priority to the ideological revolution while pushing forward the technological and cultural revolutions is the basic way of accomplishing the Juche-oriented socialist cause by successfully building a powerful socialist country and ultimately solving the rural question.\nOnly when the technological revolution is carried on dynamically in the countryside, can the essential differences between agricultural labour and industrial labour be eliminated, the agricultural workers be freed from backbreaking and hard labour and a rapid increase be brought about in agricultural production.\nUAWK organizations should regard the technological revolution as a vital demand for agricultural development and socialist rural construction and make a positive contribution to achieving a high level of irrigation, electrification, mechanization and application of agrochemicals in the rural economy. They should pay particular attention to the comprehensive mechanization of the rural economy, in order to radically raise the level of mechanization in farm work. They should vigorously conduct the movements for invention, technical conception and technical innovation for agricultural development, and make sure that the agricultural workers possess one or more techniques and know how to operate modern farm machines skilfully. The agricultural workers should be well-versed in agricultural science and technology and advanced farming methods and do all their farm work in a scientific and technological way. By doing so, they can become undertakers and masters of scientific farming.\nStepping up the cultural revolution in the countryside is one of the important tasks for building a civilized socialist nation.\nThe agricultural workers should be involved in the study-while-you-work system in line with the requirements of making all the people be well-versed in science and technology, and prepared as intelligent workers of a new era possessed of agricultural knowledge and science and technology. By effectively running the halls of culture in ri and agricultural sci-tech learning spaces in farms and workteams, the agricultural workers can acquire scientific and technological knowledge concerned with farming and other fields as befit masters of the cultured socialist countryside.\nUAWK organizations should make sports mass-based and part of daily life in the countryside, so as to increase the ranks of model sports units and make the enthusiasm for sports prevail in the rural villages across the country. They should conduct various forms of mass-based cultural and artistic activities to make the songs of struggle and life ring out in the farm fields and encourage the agricultural workers to work and live in an optimistic way, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm.\nUAWK members in the rural education and public health sectors should improve the level of education of rising generations and medical service by thoroughly implementing our Party’s policies on education and public health.\nUAWK organizations should lead their members and other agricultural workers to spruce up their villages and houses in a hygienic and cultured way, plant fruit trees at every house and cover the mountains around their villages with thick forests out of warm affection for their country and native lands, so as to turn the rural villages into civilized and beautiful socialist paradises.\nThey should enlist their members and other agricultural workers in the struggle to carry out the Party’s agricultural policy, and thus effect a radical turn in agricultural production.\nThe agricultural front is an outpost in the battle for defending socialism. We must farm well and thus solve the problem of food for the people; only then can we defend our style of socialism and build a powerful socialist country successfully.\nUAWK organizations and agricultural workers should attain by all means the agricultural production target set by the Seventh Party Congress and make our country rich in grains, vegetables, meat and fruits by bringing about a great innovation and great leap forward in agricultural production.\nThe masters of farming are farmers, and the key to increased agricultural production lies in inspiring the agricultural workers with enthusiasm for production. They should do all farm work in a scientific way and assiduously and meticulously as required by the Juche farming method from the standpoint of being masters responsible for filling the country’s granaries, and execute the agricultural production plan without fail. The field responsibility system should be introduced as intended by the Party, so as to enhance the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for production on the part of the agricultural workers.\nUAWK organizations should carry out the Party’s policy on scientific farming.\nThe present is an era of scientific farming, and agricultural production is guaranteed not by natural and climatic conditions but by agricultural science and technology.\nTo bring about a turn in agricultural production, it is imperative to breed many high-yielding, superior grain species and propagate them on a large scale by holding fast to the Party’s policy on the seed revolution as the lifeline. Along with it, efforts should be concentrated on fully solving the scientific and technological problems arising in agricultural development such as studying and developing advanced farming techniques and methods and inventing and introducing high-performance farm machines and implements.\nThe agricultural sector should breed seeds and distribute crops correctly as suited to the features of relevant localities, manure and cultivate them on a scientific and technological basis, actively introduce advanced farming methods and establish the food production cycle, thus putting farming on a higher scientific and intensive footing. The sector should ensure that the validity and vitality of the Party’s policy on scientific farming are manifested in practice frequently and vividly by increasing the number of farms, workteams and sub-workteams that conduct farming on the strength of science and technology and enjoy the benefits of science and technology.\nUAWK members and other agricultural workers should take loving care of their lands and farm machines and implements.\nLand is the basic means of production in agriculture, and farm machines and implements are weapons and combat equipment for agricultural workers. UAWK organizations should ensure that their members and other agricultural workers tend the farm fields as meticulously as they would do the gardens of their own houses, and treasure and take good care of farm machines and implements. UAWK members and other agricultural workers should be encouraged to produce a larger quantity of quality manure to apply it to paddy and non-paddy fields, and make the acidified fields fertile by spreading slaked lime on them, carpeting them with fresh soil and planting legumes on them. They should also be led to keep and maintain tractors and other farm machines and facilities for agricultural production properly, repair them in time and use them effectively.\nUAWK organizations should launch mass movements vigorously among the agricultural workers.\nMass movements are powerful means for rousing the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the agricultural workers and for boosting agricultural production through collective innovation. Vigorously launching mass movements in the rural areas is an important task assigned to UAWK organizations.\nThese organizations should widely organize and conduct mass movements including the socialist emulation drive, movement to create model lathes following the example of Lathe No. 26, mass technical innovation drive and various do-good-deeds movements so as to inspire the agricultural workers continuously with enthusiasm for production.\nThe farming sector should increase the ranks of model cooperative farms continuously by encouraging provinces, counties that produce large crops and cooperative farms to compete fiercely to increase unit-area yields.\nThe stockbreeding sector should launch a competition aimed at breeding more species of domestic animals, strong in viability and quick in gaining weight, propagating them widely and overfulfilling the meat, egg and milk production plans. The fruit-growing sector should conduct the competition with the focus put on producing delicious fruits in larger amounts by putting fruit farming on a higher scientific and intensive footing. Competitions should also be organized to increase the production of vegetables, potato and cash crops.\nUAWK organizations should control and guide the mass movements efficiently. A fair judgment should be made on the results of the socialist competitions and their review and evaluation should be conducted in a meaningful way to make the mass movements undertakings of the agricultural workers themselves; then, the agricultural workers can exchange and learn good experiences they have gained while conducting these movements.\nThe UAWK should render an active contribution to the struggle for realizing the independent reunification of the country and global independence.\nIt should strive to implement the great leaders’ instructions and the Party’s line on national reunification. It should strengthen solidarity and collaboration with the progressive peasants unions in south Korea and render support to the peasants and other people in south Korea in their struggle for anti-US independence, democratization of society and national reunification.\nIt should defend the high international prestige of the great leaders and their achievements in external activities, steadfastly apply the ideals and principles of our Party’s foreign policy and strengthen friendly exchanges, cooperation and solidarity with peasants organizations in various countries of the world, so as to contribute to creating an international environment favourable for our revolution.\nIt is imperative to build up UAWK organizations and improve their militant functions and role.\nA revolutionary work system and discipline should be established in the UAWK.\nUAWK organizations should establish throughout the union a well-regulated work system of moving as one under the unified leadership of the Party Central Committee and accepting the Party’s lines and policies unconditionally and carrying them out and of planning their work by giving top priority to the implementation of their basic duty and controlling and guiding the efforts to this end in a responsible way. They should establish rigid discipline of working in line with the demands of the Rules of the union and ensure that their officials and members do not commit acts that violate the organizational discipline.\nThe Central Committee of the UAWK should plan the overall work of the union as intended by the Party and provide unified guidance over it, so as to make its organizations at all levels active, living bodies. It should conduct effective organizational and political work for implementing the great leaders’ instructions and the Party’s policies related with the union work, and provide scrupulous control and guidance to its organizations.\nProvincial, city and county committees of the UAWK should hold as their main task the internal work aimed at strengthening the lower-echelon organizations organizationally and ideologically. They should establish a well-knit system of controlling and guiding these organizations, and go down to them and help them properly.\nPrimary organizations of the UAWK should be strengthened. To strengthen them, grass-roots organizations of the UAWK, is the basis and starting point for strengthening the union as a whole. UAWK organizations at all levels should render assistance to its primary organizations effectively as intended by the Party, so as to turn them all into organizations with high fighting efficiency. They should push forward the movement of creating model primary organizations and increase their ranks.\nThe whole of the UAWK should put the main emphasis on the work with its members, the essence of its work.\nThey should properly conduct the work with its core, active members and lead them to play the vanguard role in carrying out their revolutionary tasks and become models for the masses in all aspects. They should direct strenuous efforts to the work with the laggards. There is no person in the world who was born with bad qualities, nor is there a person who cannot be educated and transformed in our socialist society. They should look after more warmly those who trouble themselves inwardly with their prospects and living conditions and foster and promote their positive deeds, however negligible they may be, so as to transform them into progressive and active elements.\nOrganizational life should be intensified among UAWK members. UAWK organizations are the bases of political life for their members; through the organizational life, UAWK members are linked inseparably with the Party with an intention and feeling of kinship and are trained to be revolutionaries. Intensifying the organizational life among the agricultural workers is all the more important as they work scattered in many cases. UAWK organizations should improve the level of the organizational and ideological life of their members by providing guidance over their organizational life substantially with a proper methodology. They should ensure that all their members treasure their organizations, work and live by relying on their organizations and carry out the decisions and assignments of their organizations without fail. They should ensure that they take part in every gathering such as a meeting and study session.\nUAWK officials should raise their own political and practical qualifications and improve their methods and style of work.\nWhether the union work is conducted properly in line with the Party’s intention or not depends on the political and practical qualifications, abilities and role of its officials. The officials should keep Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as their steadfast faith, be well-versed in the agricultural policy of the Party, possess economic, scientific and technological knowledge and common knowledge of different sectors and have high cultural attainments. UAWK organizations should scrupulously organize the work of improving the qualifications of their officials by various methods like workshops, demonstration lectures and meetings for swapping experiences.\nUAWK officials should learn from Comrade Kim Jong Il’s methods of work and apply them in their work thoroughly. They should always go deep among the masses and, while working together with the union members on the field, explain to them the Party’s policies and the scientific and technological problems and common knowledge for raising good crops.\nThey should be modest in front of the masses, mix themselves with them unceremoniously and make efforts to solve the problems arising among the union members. They should smell of earth and be exemplary in their speaking and behaviour for the union members.\nThey should eliminate formalism, expediency, clinging to the outdated way and laxity in their work, and establish a creative and enterprising style of work.\nParty organizations should effectively guide and help UAWK organizations in their work.\nParty organizations at all levels should direct their efforts to building up the ranks of UAWK officials. They should build these ranks with those who are loyal to the Party, have high political and practical qualifications, are tempered in the practical struggle and enjoy trust among the masses. They should pay close attention to educating these officials so that they can become doer-type officials who support the Party with high results in their work. They should grasp from among UAWK members who work at the production sites promising men and women as reserve officials for the UAWK, and train them systematically.\nParty organizations should promptly inform UAWK organizations of the Party’s policies and directives advanced in each period, control and guide their implementation; in particular, they should throw their weight behind them so that they can conduct various mass movements vigorously.\nThey should enhance the independence of UAWK organizations so that they can conduct their work boldly, creatively and on their own initiative with an attitude befitting masters. They should be bold in assigning tasks to the UAWK officials, help them carry out the tasks by relying on their own efforts and provide them with adequate conditions for their work. They should ensure that such practices as assigning burdensome social tasks to UAWK organizations and seconding their officials at random to other projects are not revealed.\nIt is the firm will of our Party to carry out its plan of socialist rural construction and successfully accomplish the Juche-oriented socialist cause by strengthening the UAWK and enhancing its militant functions and role, true to the noble intentions of the great leaders.\nI am firmly convinced that UAWK organizations and all its members will perform with credit their honourable mission and duties in developing the UAWK and implementing the Juche-oriented socialist cause.\n"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Has Photo Session with Participants of Congress of UAWK","body":"Kim Jong Un Has Photo Session with Participants of Congress of UAWK\n \nKim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, had a photo session with the participants of the 8th Congress of the Union of Agricultural Workers of Korea (UAWK).\nWhen he arrived at the venue of the photo session, all participants broke into cheers of \"hurrah!\"\nHe warmly congratulated the participants of the congress who devoted themselves to implementing President Kim Il Sung's and leader Kim Jong Il's idea of building socialist countryside and the agricultural policy of the WPK with loyalty and patriotism.

Address\n \nKim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, made his address on the New Year, Juche 106 (2017).\nThe full text of the address reads:\nDear Comrades,\nHaving seen out 2016, in which we glorified each and every day with gigantic struggle, creating a new history of great prosperity unprecedented in the history of the Juche revolution, we are seeing in the new year 2017.\nAvailing myself of this meaningful opportunity, when we look back with dignity upon the great year filled with proud miracles wrought by our great people, I, with the noblest mind, offer warm greetings to all the Korean people, who overcame with optimism trials of all hues unprecedented in history, sharing weal and woe with the Party and throwing in their lot with it by forming an integral whole with it in ideas, intention and will, and extend glory and blessing of the hope-filled new year to them.\nMy warm greetings go also to the compatriots in the south and abroad and to the progressive peoples of the world and other foreign friends who aspire after independence and justice.\nThe year 2016 was a year of revolutionary event, a year of great change, worthy of note in the history of our Party and country.\nLast year, amid the soaring revolutionary enthusiasm of all the Party members, service personnel and other people and great interest of the world, the Seventh Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea was held in a meaningful and splendid way as a grand political festival.\nThe congress proudly reviewed our Party’s glorious history of advancing the revolutionary cause of Juche along the victorious road under the wise leadership of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, and unfolded an ambitious blueprint for accomplishing the socialist cause under the banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. Through this historic congress, the iron will of our service personnel and people to continuously march along the road of Juche following the Party was fully demonstrated, and lasting groundwork for the Korean revolution was laid. It will be etched in the history of our country as a meeting of victors that demonstrated the invincible might of the great Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist party, as a glorious meeting that set up a new milestone in carrying out the revolutionary cause of Juche.\nLast year an epochal turn was brought about in consolidating the defence capability of Juche Korea, and our country achieved the status of a nuclear power, a military giant, in the East which no enemy, however formidable, would dare to provoke.\nWe conducted the first H-bomb test, test-firing of various means of strike and nuclear warhead test successfully to cope with the imperialists’ nuclear war threats, which were growing more wicked day by day, briskly developed state-of-the-art military hardware, and entered the final stage of preparation for the test launch of intercontinental ballistic missile; we achieved other marvellous successes one after another for the consolidation of the defence capability. This provided a powerful military guarantee for defending the destiny of the country and nation and victoriously advancing the cause of building a powerful socialist country. Our valiant People’s Army reliably defended the security of the country and the gains of the revolution by resolutely frustrating the enemy’s reckless moves for aggression and war, and gave perfect touches to its political and ideological aspects and military and technical preparations, as befits an invincible army. The brilliant successes achieved in the sector of national defence instilled a great national dignity and courage in our people, drove the imperialists and other reactionary forces into an ignominious defeat, and remarkably raised the strategic position of our country.\nLast year we achieved proud successes in the 70-day campaign and 200-day campaign organized for glorifying the Seventh Congress of the Party.\nThese campaigns were a do-or-die struggle in which all the people smashed to smithereens the enemy’s vicious schemes to isolate and suffocate our country and brought about a turning point on all fronts where a powerful socialist country is being built, a massive struggle of creation that gave birth to a new Mallima era.\nThanks to the heroic struggle of the Kim Il Sung’s and Kim Jong Il’s working class and all other people, the ambitious goals the Party set for the 70-day campaign and 200-day campaign were attained with success and a fresh breakthrough was made in the development of the national economy.\nOur resourceful, talented scientists and technicians, following the successful launch of the earth observation satellite Kwangmyongsong 4, succeeded in the static firing test of new-type high-thrust motor of the launch vehicle for a geostationary satellite. By doing so, they have opened up a broad avenue to the exploration of outer space. Also, they established fully-automated, model production systems of our own style, bred high-yielding strains with a view to ramping up agricultural production and achieved other laudable scientific and technological breakthroughs one after another. All this will be of great significance in developing the country’s economy and improving the people’s livelihood. The electric-power, coal-mining, metallurgical, chemical and building-materials industries, rail transport and other major sectors of the national economy attained their respective production and transport goals, thereby demonstrating the potential of our self-supporting economy and giving a powerful impetus to the building of a socialist economic giant. Numerous industrial establishments and cooperative farms registered the proud success of surpassing the peak-year level. The People’s Army stood in the vanguard in adding lustre to the history of “gold seas” and in creating a legendary speed at important construction sites. The sectors of education, public health and sports, too, made admirable achievements. When some areas in North Hamgyong Province were devastated by a sudden natural calamity, the whole country turned out in the restoration effort in hearty response to the Party’s appeal and achieved a miraculous success in a short span of time.\nDuring the 70-day campaign and 200-day campaign we created a new spirit of the times for building a powerful socialist country, and our people’s trust in the Party and confidence in socialism grew firmer. Last year, in which the whole country kept on seething with vigour day and night, all the Party members and other working people, youth and service personnel gave full scope to the indomitable attacking spirit of braving ordeals and difficulties, the death-defying mettle of answering the Party’s call with devotion and practice in any adversity, and the collectivist might of helping one another and leading one another forward to advance by leaps and bounds.\nThe brilliant successes we achieved in all the sectors of the revolution and construction last year are by no means attributable to any good conditions, nor are they a fortuitous result of any divine power. The mysterious power that brought about all these miraculous successes is just the single-hearted unity of all the service personnel and people, their great capacity for self-development. Even though the enemy grew more blatant in their obstructive schemes and severe difficulties cropped up one after another, all the service personnel and people drew themselves closer together around the Party and waged a vigorous struggle in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. This was how they achieved the world-startling, miraculous successes under such trying circumstances. The single-hearted unity is the lifeblood of Juche Korea and the dynamic force for a leap forward, and we must invariably follow the road of self-reliance and self-development–this is the invaluable truth of the Juche revolution confirmed by our army’s and people’s gigantic struggle in 2016.\nI extend my heartfelt thanks once again to all the service personnel and people who, with unshakeable confidence in the final victory of the revolution, adorned last year, eventful and arduous, with laudable exploits by devoting their patriotic loyalty, sweat and blood to building a powerful socialist country.\nComrades,\nWe should turn out again in the new year’s march towards a greater victory.\nTo build on the successes already gained and turn a heyday in the revolution into a great golden age is an ideological and spiritual characteristic and work style of all our service personnel and people who were trained under the care of the great leaders. In this significant year, by further encouraging the revolutionary spirit that was heightened to an incomparable degree in the course of the previous miraculous year, we should make remarkable progress in the implementation of the decisions adopted at the Seventh Congress of the Party and thus translate the people’s ideals and dreams into brilliant reality on this land.\nWe should concentrate our efforts on implementing the five-year strategy for national economic development.\nThis year is of key importance in carrying out this strategy. In order to open up fine prospects for the implementation of the strategy and develop the country’s overall economy onto a higher plane, while building on the successes gained last year, we should attain the goals for this year’s struggle without fail.\n“Let us accelerate the victorious advance of socialism with the great spirit of self-reliance and self-development as the dynamic force!”–this is the militant slogan we should uphold in this new year’s march. We should wage a vigorous all-people, general offensive to hit the targets of the five-year strategy on the strength of self-reliance and self-development.\nThe strength of self-reliance and self-development is that of science and technology, and the shortcut to implementing the five-year strategy is to give importance and precedence to science and technology.\nThe sector of science and technology should concentrate efforts on solving scientific and technological problems arising in modernizing factories and enterprises and putting their production on a regular footing with the main emphasis on ensuring the domestic production of raw materials, fuel and equipment. Production units and scientific research institutes should intensify cooperation between themselves, and enterprises should build up their own technological development forces and conduct a proactive mass-based technological innovation drive, propelling economic development with valuable sci-tech achievements conducive to expanded production and the improvement of business operation and management.\nThe electric-power, metallurgical and chemical industries should take the lead in the efforts to hit the targets of the economic strategy.\nThe electric-power industry should carry out its production plan without fail by ensuring good maintenance of generating equipment and structures and stepping up its technical upgrading. It should run the nationwide integrated power control system effectively and organize alternated production scrupulously to ensure balance between power production and consumption; it should also develop the various sources of power to create a new generating capacity on a large scale.\nThe metallurgical industry should introduce advanced technologies to lower the iron production cost and ensure normal operation of Juche-based production lines to turn out iron and steel in larger amounts. The state should take stringent measures to supply raw materials, fuel and power to the Kim Chaek and Hwanghae iron and steel complexes and other metallurgical factories.\nThe chemical industry is a basis for all other industries and plays an important role in consolidating the independence of the economy and improving the people’s living standards. This sector should revitalize production at the February 8 Vinalon Complex, expand the capacity of other major chemical factories and transform their technical processes in our own way, thus increasing the output of various chemical goods. It should direct efforts to establishing a C1 chemical industry to carry out the tasks at every stage promptly and satisfactorily.\nThe coal-mining industry and the rail transport sector should meet the demands for coal and its transport by power stations and metallurgical and chemical factories on a top priority basis.\nThe machine-building industry should be rapidly developed. Machine factories should step up their modernization, perfect the processes for the serial production of new-type tractors, vehicles and multi-purpose farm machines, and produce and supply different kinds of high-performance and quality machinery and equipment.\nThis year light industry, agriculture and fishing industry should be radically developed to make greater progress in improving the people’s living standards.\nLight industry should work out proper management strategies, regarding use of domestically available raw and other materials as their core, so as to revitalize production and bring about a turn in diversifying the range and types of consumer goods and improving their quality. It should normalize production in the mines and enterprises in the Tanchon area, so that they can prove effective in improving the people’s living standards.\nThe agricultural front, the major thrust in building an economic giant, should raise a strong wind of scientific farming and push forward the movement for increasing crop yield. It should widely introduce seeds of superior strains and scientific farming methods, whose advantages have been proved in practice, expand the area of land under two-crop farming, and be proactive in inventing and introducing high-performance farm machines. By doing so, it can attain the production goal of grains. It should adopt measures to run the livestock farming base in the Sepho area on a normal basis and increase the production of fruits, mushrooms and vegetables, so that the people can enjoy benefits from them.\nThe fishing sector should conduct a dynamic drive for catching fishes and push perseveringly ahead with aquatic farming. It should build modern fishing vessels in a greater number and lay out a comprehensive fishing equipment production base in the east coast area, so as to consolidate the material and technical foundations of the fishing industry.\nThe construction sector should complete the construction of Ryomyong Street at the highest level and concentrate its forces on the major construction projects including the building of the Tanchon Power Station, modernization of the Kim Jong Thae Electric Locomotive Complex and the development of the Wonsan area. It should also build more educational and cultural facilities and houses in an excellent way.\nUpholding the slogan of self-reliance and self-sufficiency, every field and every unit of the national economy should launch a dynamic struggle to increase production and practise economy to the maximum, and thus carry out the plan for this year on all indices.\nThe whole country should turn out in land administration. We should further transform the appearance of the land of our country by building modern tree nurseries in provinces, perseveringly pressing on with the forest restoration campaign and conducting river management, road repair and environmental conservation on a planned basis.\nIn order to bring about a turnabout in implementing the five-year strategy for national economic development, it is imperative to carry on economic guidance and business management with clear objectives and in an innovative way. The Cabinet and other economic guidance organs should work out tactics to ensure the sustainable economic development by putting the overall national economy definitely on an upward track, and implement them with an unflinching perseverance.\nAll the fronts in the sector of culture including education, public health, sports, literature and the arts should effect a new, revolutionary upsurge to accelerate the building of a civilized power. The whole country and the whole society should launch a dynamic drive this year, a year of scientific education, to improve the facilities and environment for this education.\nThe political and military position of socialism should be further cemented so that it can be an impregnable fortress.\nSingle-hearted unity is the precious revolutionary legacy the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il bequeathed to us, and herein lies the invincible might of our style of socialism. All the service personnel and people should establish the ties of kinship with the Party, their hearts pulsating to the same beat as it, and unite closely behind it in ideology, purpose and moral obligation, so as to struggle staunchly to achieve the prosperity of the country. We should thoroughly apply the people-first doctrine, the crystallization of the Juche-oriented view on the people, philosophy of the people, in Party work and all the spheres of state and social life, and wage an intensive struggle to root out abuses of power, bureaucratism and corruption that spoil the flower garden of single-hearted unity. We should resolutely thwart the enemy’s sinister and pernicious schemes to check the warm and pure-hearted aspiration of our people who follow the Party single-heartedly and to alienate the Party from them.\nIn this year of the 85th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People’s Army, we should raise the fierce flames of increasing the military capability.\nThe People’s Army should conduct the Party’s political work in a proactive manner, so as to ensure that it is pervaded with the ideology and intentions of the Party alone. It should designate this year as another year of training, another year of perfecting its combat preparedness, and ensure that all its units of different arms, services and corps raise a hot wind of perfecting their combat preparedness in order to train all its officers and men as a-match-for-a-hundred combatants, tigers of Mt Paektu, who are capable of annihilating any aggressor force at a stroke. Officers and men of the Korean People’s Internal Security Forces and members of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and Young Red Guards should prepare themselves politically and militarily and maintain full combat readiness to firmly defend the socialist system and the people’s lives and property.\nOfficials, scientists and workers in the defence industry, burning their hearts with the “Yongil bomb spirit” of the days of the anti-Japanese struggle and the revolutionary spirit of the workers of Kunja-ri of the days of the Fatherland Liberation War, should develop and produce larger quantities of powerful military hardware of our own style. By doing so, they can build up the arsenal of the Songun revolution.\nSuccess or failure of this year’s struggle aimed at carrying out the decisions of the Seventh Congress of the Party depends on the role of Party and working people’s organizations.\nParty organizations should concentrate their work on carrying out the Party’s policies and the major revolutionary tasks advanced for their respective sectors and units. They should correctly identify the problems to which the Party attaches importance and which are the main links in the whole chain of bringing about an upsurge in production, and should resolve them by enlisting all their forces. They should move the theatre of political work to the seething production sites and launch a revolutionary ideological offensive there. In this way they can powerfully arouse the masses to the general mobilization struggle for carrying out the Party’s ideas and policies. All the primary Party organizations, by applying the main spirit of the First Conference of Chairpersons of the Primary Committees of the Workers’ Party of Korea, should ensure that the spirit of continuous innovations and continuous advance is displayed to the full in this year’s all-people, general offensive.\nAll the youth league, trade union, agricultural workers’ union and women’s union organizations should enlist their members and encourage them to be astir in the advance for great upsurge, and ensure that they become innovators, creators of the Mallima speed.\nThe current stirring era demands that our officials, standard-bearers in carrying out the Party’s policies, improve their working style and attitude in a revolutionary way.\nOur people’s enthusiasm for labour is very high now; when this enthusiasm is supported by bold and scientific operations, effective command and personal examples of our officials, there is no fortress we cannot conquer and no difficulty we cannot overcome. All the officials, well aware of the noble mission they have assumed before the Party and revolution, should become locomotives that lead the masses in the vanguard of the ranks. They should plan their work in a big way with innovative insight, always think what to do and work in a keyed-up and militant way. They should resolutely break with defeatism, self-preservation, formalism and expediency, and devote their heart and soul to the struggle for carrying out the Party’s plans and intentions.\nLast year, in reflection of the national desire for reunification and the requirements of the times, we put forward the Juche-oriented line and policy of reunification at the Seventh Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea and made strenuous efforts to this end. However, the south Korean authorities turned a deaf ear to our patriotic appeal and ignored our sincere proposal. Instead, they clung to their sanctions-and-pressure schemes against the DPRK and persisted in clamouring for a war against it, thus driving inter-Korean relations towards the worst catastrophe.\nLast year, south Korea witnessed a massive anti-“government” struggle spreading far and wide to shake the reactionary ruling machinery to its foundations. This resistance involving all south Korean people, which left an indelible mark in the history of their struggle, was an outburst of pent-up grudge and indignation against the conservative regime that had been resorting to fascist dictatorship, anti-popular policy, sycophantic and traitorous acts and confrontation with their compatriots.\nThis year we will mark the 45th anniversary of the historic July 4 Joint Statement and the 10th anniversary of the October 4 Declaration. This year we should open up a broad avenue to independent reunification through a concerted effort of the whole nation.\nPositive measures should be taken to improve inter-Korean relations, avoid acute military confrontation and remove the danger of war between north and south.\nThe improvement of inter-Korean relations is the starting-point for peace and reunification, and it is a pressing demand of the whole nation. Any politician, if he or she remains a passive onlooker to the current deadlock between the two sides, can neither claim to be fully discharging his or her responsibility and role for the nation nor enjoy public support. Every manner of abuses and slanders aimed at offending the other party and inciting confrontation cannot be justified on any account, and an immediate stop should be put to the malicious smear campaign and other acts of hostility towards the DPRK, all designed for the overthrow of its system and any other “change.”\nWe are consistent in our stand to safeguard the security of the compatriots and peace of the country without fighting with the fellow countrymen. The south Korean authorities should not aggravate the situation by finding fault with our exercise of the right to self-defence thoughtlessly, but respond positively to our sincere efforts to prevent military conflict between north and south and ease the tension.\nThey should also discontinue arms buildup and war games.\nThe whole nation should pool their will and efforts to usher in a heyday of the nationwide reunification movement.\nAll the Korean people in the north, in the south and abroad should achieve solidarity, make concerted efforts and unite on the principle of subordinating everything to national reunification, the common cause of the nation, and revitalize the reunification movement on a nationwide scale. They should promote active contact and exchange with each other irrespective of differences in their ideologies and systems, regions and ideals, and classes and social strata, and hold a pan-national, grand meeting for reunification involving all the political parties and organizations including the authorities in the north and south, as well as the compatriots of all strata at home and abroad. We will readily join hands with anyone who prioritizes the fundamental interests of the nation and is desirous of improving inter-Korean relations.\nIt is necessary to frustrate the challenges of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad who go against the aspiration of the nation for reunification.\nWe must put an end to the moves for aggression and intervention by the foreign forces including the United States that is occupying south Korea and tries to realize the strategy for achieving hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region, and wage a dynamic pan-national struggle to thwart the moves of the traitorous and sycophantic anti-reunification forces like Park Geun Hye who, failing to see clearly who is the real arch-enemy of the nation, is trying to find a way out in confrontation with the fellow countrymen.\nWell aware of the will of the Korean nation to reunify their country, the United States must no longer cling to the scheme of whipping up national estrangement by inciting the anti-reunification forces in south Korea to confrontation with the fellow countrymen and war. It must make a courageous decision to roll back its anachronistic policy hostile towards the DPRK. The international community that values independence and justice should oppose the moves of the United States and its vassal forces aimed at wrecking peace on the Korean peninsula and checking its reunification, and the neighbouring countries should act in favour of our nation’s aspiration and efforts for reunification.\nAll the fellow countrymen in the north, in the south and abroad should do something to make this year a meaningful year of a new phase in independent reunification by stepping up a nationwide grand march towards reunification through the concerted effort of the nation.\nLast year the imperialist reactionary forces’ moves for political and military pressure and sanctions against our country reached an extreme. But they failed to break the faith of our service personnel and people in victory, and could not check the vigorous revolutionary advance of Juche Korea.\nWe will continue to build up our self-defence capability, the pivot of which is the nuclear forces, and the capability for preemptive strike as long as the United States and its vassal forces keep on nuclear threat and blackmail and as long as they do not stop their war games they stage at our doorstep disguising them as annual events. We will defend peace and security of our state at all costs and by our own efforts, and make a positive contribution to safeguarding global peace and stability.\nOur Party and the government of our Republic will remain committed to the ideals of our foreign policy of independence, peace and friendship, expand and develop the relations of good-neighbourliness, friendship and cooperation with those countries championing independence, and make concerted efforts with them to ensure genuine international justice.\nComrades,\nAs I am standing here to proclaim the beginning of another year, I feel a surge of anxiety about what I should do to hold our people in greater reverence, the best people in the world who have warmly supported me with a single mind out of their firm trust in me.\nMy desires were burning all the time, but I spent the past year feeling anxious and remorseful for the lack of my ability. I am hardening my resolve to seek more tasks for the sake of the people this year and make redoubled, devoted efforts to this end.\nPreviously, all the people used to sing the song We Are the Happiest in the World, feeling optimistic about the future with confidence in the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. I will work with devotion to ensure that the past era does not remain as a moment in history but is re-presented in the present era. On this first morning of the new year I swear to become a true servant loyal to our people who faithfully supports them with a pure conscience.\nAnd I will push the effort to set up across the Party a revolutionary climate of making selfless, devoted efforts for the good of the people.\nAs long as the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is illuminating the road ahead of us and we have the single-hearted unity of all the service personnel and people around the Party, we are sure to emerge victorious.\nLet us all march forward dynamically towards a bright future, holding up the splendid blueprint unfolded by the Seventh Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea to develop ours into a powerful socialist country.\n"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Gives Field Guidance to Newly-Built Pyongyang Bag Factory","body":"Kim Jong Un Gives Field Guidance to Newly-Built Pyongyang Bag Factory\n \nKim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), chairman of the DPRK State Affairs Commission and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, gave field guidance to the newly-built Pyongyang Bag Factory.\nThe Pyongyang Bag Factory, built in Thongil Street of Pyongyang City, is a huge modern bag producer with a total floor space of more than 10 590 square meters.

As it was led by them, the Korean children's movement could advance along a straight road following our Party alone just as sunflowers turn towards the sun, and KCU members could grow up happily with nothing to envy in the world, as successors to the revolution who will shoulder the future of the country.\nOver the past four years since the Seventh Congress of the KCU, its organizations across the country and millions of its members have lived up to the pledges they made in front of its flag, keeping pace with their vibrant motherland, which is advancing by leaps and bounds to the wonder of the world.\nKCU organizations have developed into lively and innovative revolutionary organizations that lead their members to cherish the gratefulness for the Party and their socialist country and preciousness of their organizations and collectives and to be good at studying and in the organizational life.\nMany KCU members have displayed unstained loyalty with which they hold the great Generalissimos in high esteem for ever and performed laudable deeds of devoting themselves for the sake of society, their collectives and fellows, moving the people and adding to the country's storehouse of prides.\nToday our dear KCU members are studying hard and training themselves physically and mentally with beautiful dreams and hope for tomorrow, and are actively conducting various socio-political activities and do-good-deeds movements, thus preparing themselves to be revolutionary personnel who will exalt the brilliance of socialist Korea.\nSeeing the dignified appearance of KCU members, the precious wealth of the country, who are enjoying boundless happiness and growing up as ardent young revolutionaries, masters of the future, our Party and people feel the greatest pleasure and the pride in waging the revolution.\nAs the KCU is steadfastly carrying forward the soul of Paektu, a bright, promising future is in store for the Juche revolution, Kim Il Sung's nation and\nKim Jong Il's Korea.\nIn the name of the WPK and on behalf of all our people, I once again offer warm congratulations to KCU members across the country, who are growing up to be stout pillars of a powerful socialist nation by adding lustre to the KCU's glorious traditions from one generation to the next, and also to KCU school instructors and its sub-branch teachers, who are devoting themselves heart and soul to the bright future of our motherland.\nProud delegates and all other members of the KCU,\nToday our Party, army and people, by tightening their belts, are braving all trials to increase the country's strength; this death-defying, vigorous struggle is ultimately aimed at ensuring that our rising generations enjoy all the benefits of socialism in the best country that is admired by the world.\nWhen our dear KCU members grow up cheerfully, uprightly and valiantly to be dependable pillars who will shoulder the everlasting future of our country, the inexhaustible strength of Juche Korea will increase to the maximum and the victorious advance of socialism will speed up.\nAvailing yourselves of this Eighth Congress of the KCU, you should actively swap fine experience gained in your study, organizational life, socio-political activities and do-good-deeds movements, make a fresh determination and redouble your efforts.\nDeveloping the KCU into the eternal children's organization of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and of the WPK and training all its members into true sons and daughters, young revolutionaries, of the socialist country–-this is the basic task facing KCU organizations at present.\nKCU members should become ardent young revolutionaries who are fully conversant with the greatness of the Party and the leader and the preciousness of their motherland and devote their all to the good of the country and the revolution.\nThey should always bear in mind the benevolent care the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il showed to ensure that they live happily with nothing to envy in the world, and display infinite loyalty in holding them in high esteem as the eternal Sun of Juche.\nFully aware that the red KCU neckerchief is a part of the flag of the WPK and their dreams and ideals will come true only under this flag, they should at all times and in all places think and act true to our Party's intentions.\nThe anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters and the heroes in the days of the Fatherland Liberation War and in the present Mallima era are models of a true revolutionary from whom our KCU members should take their cue.\nBy following the ennobling examples set by these revolutionary forerunners and heroes, KCU members should all become fervent revolutionaries and heroes.\nThe basic revolutionary task facing KCU members is to prepare themselves as able revolutionary personnel who are knowledgeable, morally sound and physically strong, pillars in the building of a powerful socialist country.\nThe first and foremost task for KCU members is to study well. The height of their school records represents the height of our country's future national strength.\nKCU members, bearing deep in mind the earnest request of their motherland, teachers and parents, should study hard to build the tower of knowledge higher, so as to become world-class scientists and inventors.\nThey should possess beautiful socialist moral traits.\nThey should ardently love their country and fellow people, and devote their all for the sake of society, their collective and fellows. They should respect their teachers and seniors and approach them politely, observe social order and public morality voluntarily, and be honest and upright in their everyday life.\nHealthy body of KCU members is an asset of the country. Only when they grow up stoutly in good health can the country be full of vigour and become stronger.\nKCU members should conduct brisk sporting activities to build up their physique, foster bravery and gallantry, and possess the techniques of more than one sports event.\nKCU members should also take an active part in art group activities, improving their cultural attainments and bringing their artistic talents into full bloom by singing songs, reciting poems and playing musical instruments.\nThey should devote their all to adding brilliance to the socialist system of our country.\nThey should not become self-indulgent sons and daughters seeking their own happiness, but young patriots who, cherishing Kim Jong Il's patriotism, treasure all the assets our revolutionary forerunners created on this land at the cost of their sweat and blood, and tend every tree and every blade of grass in their country with earnest care.\nThey should step up various socio-political activities and do-good-deeds movements so as to encourage their fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters in their heroic struggle to build a powerful socialist country and contribute to their country's economic development.\nThey should hate imperialists and other class enemies, maintain sharp revolutionary vigilance against their schemes and mentally prepare themselves to fight, if the enemies dare invade the country, as bravely as the Children's Corps members did during the anti-Japanese armed struggle and the children's vanguard members in the days of the Fatherland Liberation War.\nThey should, through organizational life, improve their sense of organization and discipline and exalt the honour of being members of the glorious Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's organization of children.\nThe pledge they took in front of the KCU flag is the first vow they made to their motherland, and their life in KCU organizations is the process of political activities through which they keep this pledge.\nThey should always love and treasure their organizations, observe organizational discipline on a voluntary basis and implement without fail the tasks assigned by their organizations.\nIt is important in training them into true sons and daughters, young revolutionaries, of the socialist country to enhance the role of KCU organizations and improve guidance over its work.\nKCU organizations should ensure effectiveness in conducting the movement to learn from the glorious childhood of the great Generalissimos and the five-point educational work, so as to become revolutionary organizations that are unfailingly loyal to the Party.\nThey should make great efforts to heighten their members' spirit of collectivism, independence and creativity, thus preparing them all to be masters who will shoulder the future of a powerful socialist country.\nThe youth league assumes the heavy responsibility of properly guiding KCU members who have taken the first step towards organizational life.\nIt should give scrupulous guidance over the work of the KCU by taking into account its members' preparedness and psychological features; in particular, it should render positive help to KCU school instructors and its sub-branch teachers so that they can steadily improve the work of the KCU with a high sense of responsibility and practical qualifications.\nIt should build up the ranks of KCU activists and lead them to do the KCU work in an independent and creative way and become models for other members to emulate in studying and life.\nAll Party members and other working people should treasure and love KCU members as assets of the country and pay close attention to their education and edification as their educators and parents. In this way, they can ensure that all KCU members grow up as dependable pillars of the country amid the interest and care of the whole society.\nParty organizations at all levels should regard KCU work as an important undertaking that has a bearing on the destiny of the country and nation and the future of our revolution, and give Party-oriented guidance to it.\nDear KCU delegates,\nThe future of KCU members is endlessly bright, and a powerful socialist country, in which the song \"We Are the Happiest in the World\" resounds loudly, is reserved for them.\nOur Party, which foresees the bright future of the Juche revolution in their beautiful traits and courageous and cheerful appearance, will spare nothing for them and defend their happy laughter and bright future.\nI firmly believe that all KCU members will live up to the expectations of our Party and all people by advancing straight ahead and dynamically along the road indicated by the Party, flying high the flag of the KCU.\nMay happiness and glory be on the road of KCU members, our reliable successors and future of our powerful motherland, socialist Korea.\n"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Has Photo Session with Participants in 8th KCU Congress","body":"Kim Jong Un Has Photo Session with Participants in 8th KCU Congress\n \nRespected Marshal Kim Jong Un had a photo session with the participants in the 8th Congress of the Korean Children's Union (KCU).\nWhen Kim Jong Un appeared at the venue of the photo session, KCU delegates presented a fragrant bouquet to him and put a red tie around his neck.\nThe 8th Congress of the KCU was an important occasion for further developing it into eternally glorious children's union of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, he said, and warmly congratulated the participants in the congress who displayed over the world the spirit of three million KCU members fully preparing themselves to be reliable reserves for building a socialist power and true successors to the youth league by steadfastly carrying forward the traditions of the anti-Japanese children's corps and the lineage of Paektu.\nExpressing the belief that the participants in the congress would bring about a new revolutionary turn in the KCU work and strengthen it into the rank of future heroes of the powerful Paektusan nation, being always ready for socialist Korea, he had a photo session with them.\nPresent at the photo session were Choe Ryong Hae, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, vice-chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and vice-chairman of the C.C., WPK; Ri Il Hwan, department director of the C.C., WPK; and Jon Yong Nam, first secretary of the Central Committee of the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League.\nPolitical News Team\n"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Guides Test-fire of New Ground-to-Sea Cruise Rocket","body":"Kim Jong Un Guides Test-fire of New Ground-to-Sea Cruise Rocket\n \nRespected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un supervised a test-fire of new-type ground-to-sea cruise rocket developed by the Academy of National Defence Science.\nThis new-type cruise rocket is a powerful attack means capable of striking any enemy group of battleships attempting at military attack on the DPRK from the ground at will.\nThe test-fire was aimed to confirm its tactical and engineering data and technical specifications and verify the combat application efficiency of the overall weapon system, including the rocket and caterpillar self-propelled launching pad vehicle.\nAt the observation post, Kim Jong Un learned about the tactical and engineering data of the rocket and ordered the start of its test-fire.\nThe launched cruise rockets accurately detected and hit the floating targets on the East Sea of Korea after making circular flights.\nThe test-fire verified such specifications as separation of rocket from the tube of caterpillar self-propelled launching pad vehicle, start-up of engines and rapid admission into zero-feet flight.

Test-launch of Inter-continental Ballistic Rocket Hwasong-14\n \nThe scientists and technicians of the DPRK Academy of Defence Science on July 4 successfully carried out the test-launch of inter-continental ballistic rocket Hwasong-14 newly developed by them under the personal guidance of Kim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army.\nRespected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un supervised the test-launch on the spot.\nOver a few days ahead of the test-launch, he frequented the place where the general drive for assembling the rocket was underway and meticulously guided the scientists and technicians in their busy preparations for the test-launch.\nFeasting his eyes on the newly made inter-continental ballistic rocket Hwasong-14, he stressed that the protracted showdown with the U.S. imperialists has reached its final phase and it is the time for the DPRK to demonstrate its mettle to the U.S. which is testing its will in defiance of its warning.\nAt dawn of the day of the test-launch he again came out to the rocket test-launching ground to acquaint himself with the plan for the test-launch.\nThe test-launch was aimed to confirm the tactical and technological specifications and technological features of the newly developed inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of carrying large-sized heavy nuclear warhead and to finally verify all technical features of the payload of the rocket during its atmospheric reentry including the heat-resisting features and structural safety of the warhead tip of ICBM made of newly developed domestic carbon compound material, in particular.\nBy order of the respected Supreme Leader, the inter-continental ballistic rocket Hwasong-14 of Juche Korea was launched at 09:00.\nThe test-launch confirmed the features of the rocket's blast-off from its launching pad and technological features of its guidance and stability system in its active-flight stages and structural system.\nIt also reconfirmed the features of starting and stopping the first-stage high-thrust engine and confirmed the starting, stopping and working features of the newly developed second-stage engine of higher thrust under actual flying conditions.\nIt also checked the operational accuracy and creditability of the newly designed stage-separation system, reconfirmed the attitude control features of the heavy warhead in intermediate course after its separation from the rocket and confirmed the homing features and structural safety during the harshest atmospheric reentry environment.\nSpecifically, the inner temperature of the warhead tip was maintained at 25 to 45 degrees centigrade despite the harsh atmospheric reentry conditions of having to face the heat reaching thousands of degrees centigrade, extreme overload and vibration, the nuclear warhead detonation control device successfully worked, and the warhead accurately hit the targeted waters without any structural breakdown at the end of its flight.\nThe test-fire verified that the maneuverability of the mobile launcher loaded with an inter-continental ballistic rocket and all technological specifications of preparatory processes for launch were suited to the tactical and technological requirements of the weapon system.\nKim Jong Un watched the flight of the rocket displayed on monitors at the observation post.\nHe analyzed the results of the test-fire of Hwasong-14 and declared that it was a very great success.\nHe, with a broad smile on his face, told officials, scientists and technicians that the U.S. would be displeased to witness the DPRK's strategic option as it was given a \"package of gifts\" incurring its disfavor by the DPRK on its \"Independence Day\", calling on them to frequently send big and small \"gift packages\" to the Yankees as ever so that they would not feel weary.\nHe highly praised the scientists and technicians of the Academy of Defence Science for thrillingly succeeding at one try in even the test-launch of Hwasong-14 capable of striking the U.S. mainland this time, thus fully demonstrating the dignity of independent Juche Korea and indomitable spirit of its heroic people and devotedly defending the absolute authority of the Workers' Party of Korea.\nSaying that the great success in the test-launch of Hwasong-14 is another brilliant victory of the Korean people in their struggle against the U.S.-led imperialists, he expressed high respect and thanks to the great Korean people who have absolutely supported and upheld the WPK's line of simultaneously developing the two fronts without any vacillation despite blatant challenge from the U.S. imperialists and their followers and manifold hardships.\nNoting that the overall national strength and strategic position of the DPRK have been put on a new level as it is possessed of A-bomb, H-bomb and even inter-continental ballistic rocket, he said that everyone should take pride in having firmly consolidated the powerful nuclear war deterrence despite the hostile forces' persistent pressure and sanctions.\nHe stressed that the DPRK would neither put its nukes and ballistic rockets on the table of negotiations in any case nor flinch even an inch from the road of bolstering the nuclear force chosen by itself unless the U.S. hostile policy and nuclear threat to the DPRK are definitely terminated.\nHe had a photo session with the scientists, technicians and officials of the Academy of Defence Science who successfully

At night of Friday he visited the rocket-launching site to guide the test-fire on the spot.\nThe test-launch was aimed to finally confirm the overall technological specifications of the weapon system of Hwasong-14 capable of carrying large-sized heavy nuclear warhead, including its maximum range.\nBy order of the Supreme Leader, the inter-continental ballistic rocket Hwasong-14 loaded with the tremendous might of heroic Korea roared into space, leaving a column of flames behind.\nThe rocket that blasted off from the northwestern part of the DPRK reached an altitude of 3, 724.9km and flew 998km for 47 minutes and 12 seconds before landing in the target waters in the open sea.\nThe test-fire was carried out at the maximum angle launch system mocking the maximum range, and had no adverse effect on the security of the neighboring countries.\nThe test also reconfirmed the specific features of the rocket system such as the rocket's separation from its launching pad, stage-separation, structural system, etc. which were confirmed at the first test-fire, and confirmed the performing features of motors whose number has increased to guarantee the maximum range in the active-flight stage as well as the accuracy and reliability of the improved guidance and stability system.\nThe attitude control features of heavy warhead in the middle flight stage after the separation of warhead were reconfirmed, and the accurate guidance and attitude control of warhead was ensured at the atmospheric reentry at the angle launch system harsher than the actual maximum range flying conditions. The structural stability of warhead was maintained and the warhead explosion control device showed normal operation even at the thousands of degrees of Centigrade.\nExpressing great satisfaction over the results of the test-fire of ICBM which proved to be a perfect and big success without an inch of error, Kim Jong Un highly praised the scientists, technicians and officials in the field of rocket research and gave them special thanks in the name of the Party Central Committee.\nThe test-fire reconfirmed the reliability of ICBM system, demonstrated the capability of making surprise launch of ICBM in any region and place any time, and clearly proved that the whole U.S. mainland is in the firing range of the DPRK missiles, he said with pride.\nThe maximum range simulation test-fire of ICBM conducted by the DPRK today is meant to send a grave warning to the U.S. making senseless remarks, being lost to reason, he said, adding this would make the policy-makers of the U.S. properly understand that the U.S., an aggression-minded state, would not go scot-free if it dares provoke the DPRK.\nThe U.S. trumpeting about war and extreme sanctions and threat against the DPRK only emboldens the latter and offers a better excuse for its access to nukes, he said, stressing: To the Korean people who experienced disastrous disturbances of war on this land by the beast-like U.S. imperialists, the powerful war deterrence for defending the state is an inevitable strategic option and it is a precious strategic asset that can not be bartered for anything.\nIf the Yankees brandish the nuclear stick on this land again despite our repeated warnings, we will clearly teach them manners with the nuclear strategic force which we had shown them one by one, he emphasized.\nKim Jong Un warmly congratulated the scientists and technicians in the field of rocket research who demonstrated once again the independent prestige and dignity of Juche nuclear power, the world-level rocket power by succeeding in the second test-launch of ICBM Hwasong-14. He, taking them in his arms, had a photo session with them which will go down in history.\nThe DPRK, advancing along the new line of the great Workers' Party of Korea on simultaneously building up the economy and defence, will develop much more the most powerful strategic weapons, Juche weapons which will display the invincible might of Juche Korea and its inexhaustible potentiality of development to the world until the U.S. and its vassal forces trying to undermine the DPRK's dignity and its right to existence are eliminated, and will achieve the final victory in the showdown with the imperialists and the U.S. without fail.\nAccompanying him were Ri Pyong Chol, Kim Rak Gyom, Kim Jong Sik, Jang Chang Ha, Jon Il Ho, Yu Jin and Jo Yong Won.\nPolitical News Team\n"},{"title":"Kim Jong Un Issues Order for 2nd Test-fire of ICBM Hwasong-14","body":"Kim Jong Un Issues Order for 2nd Test-fire of ICBM Hwasong-14\n \nRespected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un signed the order to carry out the second test-fire of intercontinental ballistic rocket Hwasong-14 on July 27, Juche 106 (2017).\n"},{"title":"Banquet Given in Presence of Kim Jong Un to Celebrate Successful Second Test-fire of Hwasong-14","body":"Banquet Given in Presence of Kim Jong Un to Celebrate Successful Second Test-fire of Hwasong-14\n \nThe Central Committee and the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea gave a banquet at the Mokran House on Sunday in celebration of the successful second test-fire of ICBM Hwasong-14.\nRespected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un was present at the banquet.

peninsula into the worst brink of explosion, to take into full account the gains and losses with clear head, whether the present situation is more unfavorable for which side.\nIn order to defuse the tensions and prevent the dangerous military conflict on the Korean peninsula, it is necessary for the U.S. to make a proper option first and show it in action, as it deployed huge nuclear strategic

said that if the Yankees persist in their extremely dangerous actions around the Korean peninsula, testing the self-restraint of the DPRK, the latter will make a crucial decision as it had already declared, warning the U.S. that it should think reasonably and judge properly so as not to suffer another shame by the DPRK under the eyes of the world.\nIf the planned fire of power demonstration is carried out due to the U.S. rashness going beyond the limit line, this will be the most delightful historic moment when our Hwasong artillerymen wring the windpipes of the Yankees and point daggers at their necks, he said, underlining the need to always stand on fire readiness for going into action once our Party decides.\nThen the Supreme Leader went round a military training school and a gymnasium and called for firmly establishing Juche in education and steadily improving the quality of military training to prepare all the Hwasong artillerymen of the large combined unit to be

forces located in the Pacific operational theater in contingency and intermediate-and-long range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12.\nAs known to the world, the intermediate-and-long range strategic ballistic rocket launching drill of the KPA Strategic Force was conducted as a part of the muscle-flexing to counter the Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military drills the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces finally kicked off in disregard of the DPRK's meaningful and crucial warning.\nThe drill was carried out through the combination of sudden maneuvers and strike in order to estimate and examine the posture of the KPA Strategic Force for prompt counteraction in contingency on the Korean peninsula and to confirm the actual war operation capacity of the
